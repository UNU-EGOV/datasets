2007,Advancing e-governance: connecting learning and action,"Dawes, Sharon S.",United States,actions; governance; improvement; innovation; learning; public management; public sector,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Theory and practice of electronic governance,10.1145/1328057.1328059,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?preflayout=flat&doid=1328057.1328059,E-Governance;Governance;E-Government;Government;Public sphere;Public administration,2,228,"Electronic Governance is defined in many ways, but all the definitions include an expectation of innovation and improvement in the public sphere. Innovation entails experimentation and risk. Improvement requires deep understanding of the context of government, as well as new tools and new ways of working. Accordingly, advancing electronic governance demands both learning and action. This talk will focus on ways to conceptualize, operationalize, and capitalize on ways to link research and practice in a shared and mutually rewarding enterprise aimed at better public management and better governance."
2007,An overview of the implementation of e-government program in Nigeria,"Agunloye, Olu",Nigeria,e-government implementation; e-government solution model; e-readiness; framework; government establishment; integration platform; partnership,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Theory and practice of electronic governance,10.1145/1328057.1328060,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?preflayout=flat&doid=1328057.1328060,E-Government;Computer program;Financial institution;Government;Public sector;Partnership,0,345,"e-Government implementation framework has been established in Nigeria and is being executed in four phases. Over the last three years and particular now at the stage of full roll-out of e-Government solutions, e-Readiness capacities are being built within the public service at the Federal, State and Local Government tiers as well as within the Private Sector, especially the banking and financial institutions and also within professional associations and groups. This paper describes the adopted e-Government model, its implementation strategy and platform for integration as well as the reinforcing roles of various Government establishments. It also describes the multiple partnerships with financial institutions and technical solution providers that lead to development of e-Government programs in Ministries, Departments and Agencies, under the basic guidelines and deployment of citizen-centric e-Government solutions."
2007,E-government global readiness report 2008 from e-government to knowledge management,"Bertucci, Guido",United States,it planning; citizens; data mining; data security; governments; human resources; leadership; physical infrastructures; privacy issues; public sector; public value; strategy; training and retraining; vision,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Theory and practice of electronic governance,10.1145/1328057.1328061,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?preflayout=flat&doid=1328057.1328061,E-Government;Globalization;Knowledge management;Public value;Transparency (behavior);Information privacy;Electronic business;Public sector,0,526,"ICTs can help reinvent government in such a way that existing institutional arrangements can be restructured and new innovative arrangements can flourish, paving the way for a transformed government. This supposedly transformed government is more responsive to the needs of citizens and businesses, more efficient, more transparent and participatory. The questions that arise then are what is the implementation pace of e-government initiatives around the world and how can the real needs of citizens be met. The UN Global E-Government Readiness Report, 2008, seeks to provide answers to these questions by quantitatively assessing the strengths and weaknesses in e-government initiatives worldwide. The 2008 Report deals with these issues from the perspective of leveraging the knowledge of public organizations, since knowledge management has the potential to improve the electronic provision of services. In their effort to provide public value to citizens, governments throughout the world face a number of challenges. Such challenges range from thoughtful IT planning, providing finance and adequate physical infrastructures in a rapidly changing technological environment, confronting problems related to existing IT infrastructure, reducing the operational cost structure of services that they provide, retaining and retraining staff, leadership and other human resources issues, data mining issues and providing for the adequate protection of data, and security and privacy issues. E-government provides a vision and a strategy for addressing these challenges and for creating an environment for the transformation of government activities by applying ebusiness methods on the public sector."
2007,Technological foundations of electronic governance,"Davies, Jim; Janowski, Tomasz; Ojo, Adegboyega; Shukla, Aadya",United Kingdom; Macao; Macao; United Kingdom,e-governance; formal techniques,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Theory and practice of electronic governance,10.1145/1328057.1328063,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?preflayout=flat&doid=1328057.1328063,,3,499,"This paper explores the relevance and opportunities for the application of mature Formal Techniques - techniques based on mathematical theories and supported by industry-ready tools and methods - to build technical solutions for Electronic Governance. The paper proceeds in four steps: (1) establishes the basic need for Formal Techniques in Electronic Governance, (2) identifies the challenges peculiar to Electronic Governance development, (3) presents the salient features and various application scenarios for Formal Techniques in general, and (4) carries out a mapping between the challenges to Electronic Governance and various application scenarios of Formal Techniques as part of solutions to such challenges. In the second part, the paper presents an overview of the tutorial and workshop on Formal Engineering Methods for Electronic Governance. The tutorial follows the fourstep program, as above, and the workshop includes the presentations of four papers that exemplify various elements of the mapping, particularly: the use of formal, precise modeling techniques; the importance of security risk assessment; modeldriven development of software systems; and the provision of semantic frameworks to coordinate development within and across major programs and initiatives. In the last part, the paper discusses how Formal Techniques can contribute to establishing a solid foundation for Electronic Governance."
2007,Automatic generation of e-government forms from semantic descriptions,"Stadlhofer, Bernd; Salhofer, Peter",Austria; Austria,gea; owl; rdf; xforms; xsd; e-government; semantic web,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Theory and practice of electronic governance,10.1145/1328057.1328064,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?preflayout=flat&doid=1328057.1328064,E-Government;Semantics;Semantic Web Services;Resource Description Framework;Semantic Web;Business rule;Ontology;Public administration,3,395,"Currently there are numerous initiatives for applying Semantic Web technologies to e-Government. Most of these efforts concentrate on the definition, discovery, orchestration and execution of Semantic Web services. The focus is thereby often on system-to-system communication and less on human-computer interaction. In this paper we present a way to generate web-forms out of an existing semantic description. The core difference to most of the existing similar approaches is that our semantic description does not focus on web-service description: it simply utilizes Semantic Web technologies to provide a logic description of Public Administration Services and relevant parts of the e-Government domain. The idea is to automatically identify relevant input for a Public Administration Service based on the semantic description of the service and its business rules that must be applied to create the particular results. According to the relevant input a web-form is generated to gather the needed information from the citizen. This input is interactively checked against the procedure's business rules. If the provided data is correct and conforms to the ontology's restriction, the data, represented as XML and RDF, can be consumed by any application supporting the data interchange standard including Semantic Web services."
2007,Formal support for e-government system design with transparency consideration,"Chen, Xiaoyi; Kong, Weiqiang; Futatsugi, Kokichi",Japan; Japan; Japan,domain engineering; formal methods; license language; public administration; the ots/cafeobj method,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Theory and practice of electronic governance,10.1145/1328057.1328065,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?preflayout=flat&doid=1328057.1328065,,0,321,"In this paper, we introduce formal methods into the field of e-Government (or public administration) for formalizing e-Government system design, trying to extract a formal definition of transparency in public administration from former studies on transparency, and analyzing if the design of e-Government systems satisfies transparency related properties. Another contribution made in this paper is that we propose a digital right management license language (Public Administration License Language, called PALL as well) for e-Government systems, especially for using it to guarantee the transparency related properties in e-Government system design. Classical digital right license languages are applied to electronic ""downloading"", payment and rendering of artistic works, while we extend the concept of license to cover work authorization in public government. The digital works are public government documents in this context. As digital right license for artistic works seeks to safeguard against privacy and to ensure proper payment for the rights to render these works, PALL seeks to ensure transparent and professional ""good governance""."
2007,Semantic frameworks for e-government,"Crichton, Charles; Davies, Jim; Gibbons, Jeremy; Harris, Steve; Shukla, Aadya",United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom,metadata; model-driven; ontology; semantic web,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Theory and practice of electronic governance,10.1145/1328057.1328066,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?preflayout=flat&doid=1328057.1328066,,6,650,"This paper explains how semantic frameworks can be used to support successful e-Government initiatives by connecting system design to a shared understanding of interactions and processes. It shows how metadata standards and repositories can be used to establish and maintain such an understanding, and how they can be used in the automatic generation and instantiation of components and services. It includes an account of a successful implementation at an international level, and a brief review of related approaches."
2007,Formal threat descriptions for enhancing governmental risk assessment,"Ekelhart, Andreas; Fenz, Stefan; Neubauer, Thomas; Weippl, Edgar",Austria; Austria; Austria; Austria,formal threat descriptions; inventory; security ontology,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Theory and practice of electronic governance,10.1145/1328057.1328067,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?preflayout=flat&doid=1328057.1328067,,1,589,"Compared to the last decades, we have recently seen more and more governmental applications which are provided via the Internet directly to the citizens. Due to the long history of IT systems in the governmental sector and the connection of these legacy systems to newer technologies, most governmental institutions are faced with a heterogeneous IT environment. More and more governmental duties and responsibilities rely solely on IT systems which have to be highly dependable to ensure the proper operation of these governmental services. An increasing amount of software vulnerabilities and the generally heightened physical threat level due to terror attacks and natural disasters demand for a holistic IT security approach which captures, manages, and secures the entire governmental IT infrastructure. Our contribution is (1) a novel inventory solution, (2) a mechanism to embed the virtual IT infrastructure data into a physical model provided by our security ontology, and (3) a methodology to automatically identify threatened assets and to reason on the current security status based on formal threat definitions taking software configurations and physical locations into account. A prototypical implementation of the aforementioned concepts shows how these concepts help governmental institutions to secure their IT infrastructure in a holistic and systematic way to fortify their IT systems in an appropriate way against current and future threats."

A basic prerequisite for collaboration is interoperability, which can be defined as the ability of systems to work together with other systems. The building of interoperable system requires considering governance, organizational, strategic, social and technical issues. This tutorial and workshop is aimed at contributing to the understanding of the scope of the issues involved in e-government interoperability and solutions to address them. Interoperability has been improved at the technical level by the introduction of service-oriented architecture and web services technology, however, many research questions remain open at the semantic and pragmatic levels. Interoperation and integration also require many other aspects, which might be harder to establish than the technical underpinnings. At least, the governance of the architecture of the many organizations collaborating with each other is needed to improve interoperability."
2007,SORIG: a service-oriented framework for rural information grid -- an implementation viewpoint,"Patra, Manas Ranjan; Das, Rama Krushna",India; India,e-governance; rural information services; service-oriented architecture,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Theory and practice of electronic governance,10.1145/1328057.1328070,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?preflayout=flat&doid=1328057.1328070,Service-oriented architecture;Grid computing;Software framework;Rural area;Scalability;Information needs,2,330,"In this paper, we describe a project called SORIG (Service-Oriented Framework for Rural Information Grid) which has been undertaken specifically to address the information needs of the rural population of India. The novelty of this project is that it is geared towards integrating several existing systems built on heterogeneous platforms and operating environments under different administrative zones. In order to provide a user-centric view of the information resources and address the issue of scalability of the system, the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has been used. The project aims at providing ""one-stop"" access to various information resources for the benefit of the rural community that constitutes the largest section of the Indian population. The paper focuses on the implementation details and also discusses about several services that are available at the moment to the rural mass."

2007,Adaptability and accountability of information architectures in interorganizational networks,"Janssen, Marijn",The Netherlands,accountability; adaptability; coordination; flexibility; information architecture; interorganizational networks; orchestration; public service networks; service-oriented architecture,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Theory and practice of electronic governance,10.1145/1328057.1328072,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?preflayout=flat&doid=1328057.1328072,Information architecture;Accountability;Adaptability;Computer network;Organization;Information system;Loose coupling;Provisioning,4,443,"Governmental service provisioning is increasingly organized around networks of agencies. These agencies have various objectives and a variety of heterogeneous types of information systems. Each agency can independently design (a set of) subsystems that should function together to provide a service. Often the collaborating organizations have various degrees of technology-readiness and different objectives and interests. The service executing depends on the weakest subsystem and total network performance need to be accounted for. Furthermore, network arrangements are likely to change and evolve over time and need to adapt to changing circumstances, whereas, the entire network's performance is dependent on the performance of the individual departments. In this paper we investigate adaptability and accountability aspects of information systems in networks of organizations. Adaptability is the ability to deal with new environmental conditions. Accountability is the answerability for one's actions or inactions and to be responsible for their consequences. Adaptability requires a loosely coupled structure, which can seriously hamper accountability. Accountability requires tight integration and clear processes. We analyzed the adaptability and accountability aspects in two case studies. The case studies demonstrate that both requirements are not necessarily conflicting and can be complimentary. More research is necessary on designing architectures which are able to meet the adaptability and accountability requirements at the same time."
2007,Government role in developing an interoperability ecosystem,"Baird, Stacy Avery",United States,culture; economy; government; interoperability; law; politics; public policy; social theory; society; standards,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Theory and practice of electronic governance,10.1145/1328057.1328073,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?preflayout=flat&doid=1328057.1328073,Interoperability;Government;Ecosystem,1,267,"The article describes the five facets of the interoperability ecosystem and offers insight into a constructive role for governments in facilitating each aspect individually, as well as in promoting the interoperability ecosystem as a whole."
2007,Tutorial and workshop on knowledge management in public administration,"Wimmer, Maria A.; Traunmüller, Roland",Germany; Austria,architectures; information; knowledge; knowledge management; knowledge structuring,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Theory and practice of electronic governance,10.1145/1328057.1328075,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?preflayout=flat&doid=1328057.1328075,Knowledge management;Public administration;Domain knowledge;Enterprise architecture;Ontology (information science),2,423,"The public sector is dealing with information and knowledge resources by and large. Many activities and results are of the nature of information and knowledge. However, there is a big lack of a clear and comprehensive understanding of how knowledge and information can be used effectively and under the conditions of public sector activity, compliance to laws and privacy rules. In addition, the understanding of what ICT systems can support the huge amount of knowledge existing in the public sector most effectively is still poor. The tutorial and workshop at ICEGOV2007 will contribute to a better understanding of knowledge management requirements of public administration and the available solutions. The tutorial will teach the fundamentals of knowledge management techniques including the use of Enterprise Architectures and ontologies within government for knowledge and information sharing, planning and interoperability. The workshop session will feature four papers and discussions related to state-of-the-art applications of knowledge management in the government domain, tools and techniques for knowledge management, enterprise architectures and ontologies."
2007,Fix my street or else: using the internet to voice local public service concerns,"King, Stephen F.; Brown, Paul",England; England,citizen voice; e-government; local government; public service transformation; virtual community,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Theory and practice of electronic governance,10.1145/1328057.1328076,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?preflayout=flat&doid=1328057.1328076,Voice over Internet Protocol;Internet;Virtual community;Internet forum;Online community;Government;Public sector;Citizenship,32,618,"UK local governments have invested heavily in ICT in recent years to improve public service delivery. Most local governments now operate contact centres and websites to exchange information and transactions with citizens. But the aspirations of central government go much further - to service ""transformation"" - and the expectation that citizens and communities will be actively engaged in service design and delivery. In parallel with this new political agenda, technological developments are enabling users to create their own online fora, and to generate their own content. These fora often address public service areas, such as healthcare, crime and education. This paper presents an evaluation of one of the first citizen-driven systems for local public service improvement in the UK: FixMyStreet.com (FMS). The system enables citizens to report, view or discuss local problems such as graffiti, fly tipping, broken paving slabs or street lighting, and to track their resolution by the local government concerned. The system went live in February 2007. FMS has attracted over 3000 problem reports and updates in its first six months, and is viewed very favourably by the citizens surveyed here. But many problems reported to the site remain ""unfixed"" with status ""unknown"". Local government officers voice a number of concerns: the site duplicates their own websites; they cannot report fixes directly to ensure the information is up-to-date; nor can they manage user expectations regarding service performance. And the site has no ""sense of virtual community"" (SOVC) [1], with individuals posting in isolation without the support of fellow citizens to amplify their voices or to contribute to problem resolution. The paper concludes by combining the concept of SOVC, factors identified as encouraging growth in online communities, and the example of a successful London community website, BRAIN, to suggest possible future developments for FMS and for public service fora in general."

More specifically we promote the idea of a truly low cost and generic e-Government solution that will be open for download as an integrated product and service suite that can be purchased and used for free or with an extreme low cost (similar to the 100 dollar laptop) so that some basic costs for running the promotional campaign can be subsidised. The successful realisation of our vision, depends not only on marketing a cheap product, but also on ensuring that the process of its adaptation by the potential deployment parties will stay on affortable levels."

In such organizations knowledge workers require a certain degree of freedom in structuring their own tasks [3]. This essential freedom often conflicts with the organization's need of standardization, control and transparency [5]. The vision of the research project DYONIPOS (DYnamic Ontology based Integrated Process OptimiSation) is to resolve this dilemma by automatically supporting knowledge workers with the required knowledge just in time, while avoiding additional work and violations of the knowledge worker's privacy. Furthermore DYONIPOS will support knowledge organizations by developing an organizational knowledge database, supporting the management of the developed processes and knowledge basis and visualizing workflow and processes. DYONIPOS sets up a context-sensitive, intelligent and agile assistant based on semantic and generic knowledge discovery technologies [5]. This article is structured as follows: Section 1 addresses the relation between the applied approach and the challenge in e-Government and summarizes the aims of the research project DYONIPOS. In Section 2 the semantic and knowledge discovery technologies used are presented. The paper concludes with the presentation of the use-case project, showing its current results."

Such a knowledge portal shall serve as a central entry point for the various stakeholders to a) learn about the field e-participation and its characteristics from a scientific perspective, b) to provide an instrument to further structure the field, c) to thematically cluster projects and knowledge, and at the same time d) to provide a practical instrument for the users to overview the projects and knowledge in the field. The virtual resource centre shall enable stakeholders to find relevant information and knowledge on e-participation in an effective way. To structure that information and to provide it in a reasonable way, an e-participation ontology seems to be a proper concept. The contribution will introduce a draft of the e-participation ontology, which is being developed among partners in the project. The ontology is based on scientific findings which have been developed along the first period's activities in the project."

These patterns can be used to enhance the contemporary modelling methodologies of information systems which play a crucial role in their overall efficiency. In this respect, we analyze this evolution from a structurational perspective focusing on the structuring through services and on the structuring through technologies. Through our analysis we discover modelling concepts that pervade design attempts for e-Government systems to date. Finally, we suggest an extension to an existing modelling framework (the ISO Reference Model for Distributed Processing Systems - ISO RM-ODP) which is established on the identified concepts and their corresponding structuring rules that we have defined based on our experiences. These conceptual extensions are put to use in the modelling phase of a European e-Government project (SWEB)."

Although advanced information systems are implemented in public sectors to retain valuable knowledge in the organization, researchers repetitively found that gaps exist between what senior members know and what is available in the system for newcomers to use. How to retain knowledge held by senior employees in the organization becomes a huge challenge faced by public sector management. This study argues that when using mobile information systems to facilitate fieldworkers' task performance, public sectors need to pay close attention to three factors that might influence knowledge retaining and information reuse: Knowledge tacitness, Criteria of information relevance when it is related to specific tasks, and roles played by active employees, based on observations and interviews with employees using mobile information devices here in a public sector in the Northwest of the US. Furthermore, the conflict between lower management's perception on use of mobile devices and local operation priority is cited as one of the leading reasons why many information systems fail to serve as the main information tank for organizational sustainability."

This paper takes a close look at the free and open source software policies, particularly the Icelandic one, from a software development perspective. The goal is to show how governments can utilize free and open source software when customized software is required. The paper also touches upon licensing issues for free and open source software by discussing the European Union Public License. Governmental project management and services of small software companies and the free and open source community are the focal points of the research. The basis of the research is the i2010 policy framework of the European Commission. The paper concludes by proposing a suitable methodology to use for governmental software development and recommending tools that foster both development and management, with emphasis on the latter."

This policy led Massachusetts to switch the format of its electronic documents for its public records from a proprietary, to an open standard. This article documents this historic process, as Massachusetts was the first government to switch its information technology over to open standards. The article also analyzes the Massachusetts experience to develop a set of lessons learned. The resulting guidance should aid governments that are considering policies that encourage or favor open standards."

At the same time, it is its statutory responsibility to protect privacy and personal data. However, there has been a succession of incidents of unauthorized leakage onto the Internet of personal data held by the agencies of Hong Kong government since 2006. These incidents occurred during the implementation of E-government, and aroused the public's deep concern of their privacy rights impacted by the Internet and the security of their personal data held by government agencies. This paper studies two typical cases of personal data leakage, one arising during the internal outsourcing process, the other occurring in external online service to citizens. It analyzes how the existing privacy regime addresses privacy intrusion and whether the redress is sufficient, before exploring the defects of the remedy system as well as the ways of improving legal protection of personal data within E-government environment."

The Ministry of Labour (MoL) of the UAE is the federal agency responsible of managing a labor market dominated by foreign workers - 95% of the work force. Managing a labor market of such nature is not an easy task. Between the offer and the demand, the government needs to regulate the market place in a way that is beneficiary for all players and serve the national interest in the first place. MoL is the sole authority controlling the issuance of permits to businesses to bring in foreign workers - import manpower - on temporary bases. Dealing with a population from all parts of the world with such a huge variations of legal documents make it quasi impossible to have an error free service. To review, verify and authenticate all types of documents MoL had to count on the private sector help. MoL created a network of certified service offices that act as a buffer area between MoL's services seekers and MoL organization. Smart Forms were developed in collaboration with another private sector ICT services provider, who provides all technical system infrastructure investments and works on profit-sharing principles. Authentication of documents is carried out by another private sector partner. For all these partnerships to work effectively and efficiently, a major structural reform in MoL had to be carried out. The transformation from a structure that is geared to manage the entire processes of service delivery to a completely new structure that works in partnership with other non-governmental entities -and make it works- was not an easy operation. New business concepts needed to be invented, examined and developed in special testing environments. Customization of services was another area of the reform program that was key success factor. The knowledge management program and its institutionalization was one of the pivotal axes of the transformational program. A new business architecture was developed and adopted my MoL to respond to the challenges facing it as a policy making and regulatory authority in labour market management in UAE. The transformation needed to be very carefully planned, managed and executed without any interruption of service, and has considered all internal and external engagements and commitments. An educate change management program was a key factor for the success of the transformation process. With a successful implementation of PPP, MoL today is providing all its customers with effective online services, within an efficient setup."

This is reflected in the gender disparity in many sectors with women in a disadvantaged position in India. Extreme poverty and poor IT infrastructure in rural areas, where the majority of Indian women reside, further restrict women's access to education and information technology. Such an iniquitous position of women has contributed enormously to the slow pace of development in India. The issue of gender equity is not a supplement to development and e-governance but central to both. While the e-governance initiatives are theoretically comprehensive and aimed at inclusion of every citizen, the last digital node, unless the gender perspective is taken into account, a huge gap is bound to remain between the theory and practice of e-governance in India with attendant effects on development. Despite the many e-governance initiatives and massive investments in information communication technologies (ICTs) in India, a gender gap might exclude or restrict women to be equal partners and beneficiaries of the e- governance initiatives."

Prior studies have found that politically interested citizens use information and communication technology (ICT) to facilitate and sometimes augment their political and civic engagement [17][8][29][15] [16][34][22][21]. In the areas of political expression and civic engagement support, local groups' ICTs play important roles for communication and information sharing [16]. Do these findings also apply to young adults in local groups? In particular, earlier research about young adults' political participation shows that they increasingly turn to ICT to gather political information and as a channel of engagement [31]. This study examines the interplay of individual and local group factors for young adults by using household survey data from the town of Blacksburg, VA and environs in 2005. In this research, we present findings about who these young adults are and what they are doing with ICT for political and civic engagement in local groups. Our findings show that local group affiliation is positively associated with online political and civic engagement among young adults. Furthermore, young adults who are affiliated with local groups are more likely to report that the Internet has helped them become more involved in local issues that interest them. For a more in depth investigation of young adults affiliated with local groups, this paper suggests a framework of multilevel analysis."

To implement e-government successfully, it is important to determine the factors related to its acceptance. The purpose of this research was to assess and test the factors that are related to e-government acceptance. We drew on results obtained from prior studies on technology acceptance, e-commerce, and diffusion of innovation, and applied them to the context of e-government services in Macao. We gathered cross-sectional data from a questionnaire survey to test the factors that are hypothesized to be related to e-government adoption. The results of our analyses found that trust and compatibility explained more than 60 percent of the variance in intention to adopt e-government services in Macao. We discussed the implications of the results."

In this aspect, several benchmarking indices are available at the macro (also called global) level by the UNPAN, World Bank, EU and others, and e-Readiness indices at the macro level are constructed primarily for ranking countries. These are concerned with the global digital divide, i.e., the gap between countries that have access to ICT and those that do not, mainly because of differences in income, education, culture, etc. are being taken into consideration. However, it has been realized that a micro-level measurable criteria needs to be developed, though they already exists in discrete format, which have been developed by institutions and academics. At micro level, performance measuring tools needs to be developed to dictate appropriate design, planning, implementation, and monitoring criteria so that relevant programmes could really become essential component of society development, and at the same time contribute to human development. It is increasingly clear that for a country to put ICT for effective use, it must be ""e-ready"" in terms of infrastructure, the accessibility of ICT to the population at large, and the effect of the legal and regulatory framework on ICT use. A key indicator of e-readiness is infrastructure and in developing countries this is often a key challenge to the advancement of society. There are many elements to e-readiness such infrastructure, telecommunications, Internet connectivity and skills set as obtained from various sources. At the same time, infrastructure also refers to utilities such as roads, electricity, water and sanitation and these are all relevant components for any ICT4D-social enterprise setting up operations in developing counties. If the digital divide is going to be narrowed, all of these issues must be addressed in a coherent and achievable strategy so that they can be tailored to meet the local needs of particular countries. A good fact is that developing country leaders can use e-readiness assessment to help them measure and plan for ICT integration. It can help them focus their efforts from within, and identify areas where external support or aid is required. But an assessment alone is insufficient, and decision-makers face four key challenges in making effective use of this tool. First, they need to understand how ICT can help their countries achieve economic and social benefits, and set achievable goals accordingly. Second, they must take concrete steps toward effective and sustainable ICT uses that will help their countries realize their objectives. Third, there must be measurable criteria to be developed, so that their implementations can be ranked, and finally, an appropriate data mining solution needs to be established for taking necessary steps in reconciliation, management and future expansion. This paper would like to synthesize various measurable criteria and performance measuring tools in terms of e-Government readiness and at the same time would be performing a few analytical assessments and try to put forward recommendations on successful implementation of e-Government, especially focusing developing countries."

Government and donor funds have adopted two strategies in parallel: (i) the re-engineering and automating of government services, and (ii) the installation of telecenters (community Internet access centers) for citizens to access reengineered government ""e-Gov"" services. The model of delivering e-Gov via the Internet has major drawbacks as shown by survey data representing 397 million people at the Bottom of the Pyramid (BOP) in India, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand. First, only 49% have even heard of the Internet and only 2.6% have used it [15]. Second, it will take a lot more time and significant funds to roll-out enough telecenters to cover the BOP sufficiently. Third, most telecenters fail, while the successful ones are sustained by revenues from non-Internet services such as voice calls, fax and photocopying. But even these revenue streams may dwindle - according to our survey, over 40% of current BOP non-owners plan to purchase a phone within 2 years. They will spend their already-limited communications budgets on phones they own, not at a telecenter. By viewing the telephone as the end-device for e-service delivery, implementers can automate those parts of a government process that can deliver value quickly, through ""smaller"" (less complicated, therefore less likely to fail) applications. By not seeking to re-engineer entire government departments, these projects face less resistance to change from public-sector employees. Given that over 90% of those at the BOP use phones already [15], significant use is more likely if the necessary attention is paid to language, design and publicity. The Internet, accessed at a telecenter, and sophisticated e-Government systems will play a role in providing ""higher-end"" citizen services, for example submitting a passport application online with an uploaded digital photograph. But at a time when the Internet is barely reaching 10.3 million people at the BOP in these countries, the paper argues that phones are the cheaper, more immediate and ubiquitous tool for Asian governments to inform, transact and interact with almost 400 million of their most needy citizens. The paper presents an alternative, telephone-centric model for electronic delivery of public services citizens. It draws on research conducted by LIRNEasia in 2006 and previously published as well as unpublished e-Gov case studies."

Nepal, a developing country has also taken steps towards e-government transformation, similar to the governments in developed countries. In 2006, the Nepal Government made public its plan for initiating master plan to reduce cost and time of service recipients by improving public service delivery. The Government and responsible agencies for ICT are making efforts for the successful implementation of this plan. On the basis of my experience of more than 15 years as a government ICT officer, I see some key issues to implement e-Government master plan in Nepal. First of all, the Infrastructure and Access, a key element of the master plan is in poor state in the country. In Nepal, less the 1% of the population is using Internet and less than 10% people are connected to fix or wireless telephone network. One of the main reasons behind it is due to lack of adequate communication and electricity in the country. The transmission networks which include backbone link, microwave radio network, optical fibre network also have issues such as low quality and availability, frequent trouble in link, low capacity of links. With the present infrastructure, it is difficult to move ahead the plan. Technology adoption is another barrier while introducing digital devices in Nepalese context. Many senior level officers are nearly blind with computer technology. They do not have adequate awareness and even some of them do not want to know the benefit of ICT. The decision making officers in most of the offices are unaware with the advantage of e-Governance. Most civil servants who are enjoying the traditional non-digital technology have an attitude which is resistive to change. Those who are getting extra benefits think that they will not be able to hold the beneficial position after introducing new technology, hence are not friendly with digital devices. Besides these issues, the managing factor also challenging in the implementation of the plan. The key person's strong will to stand on behalf of the project, fostering domestic ICT workforce, introduction of fund mechanism that can attain large scale investment are some other major points to be considered. The measure factors that assess the progress to verify whether the e-Government plan is implemented in the purposed direction, consistently and continuously are also important factors."

The situation is even worse when we consider ICT and governance in local governments. The case study reported in this paper is based on an e-governance outcome evaluation framework that is being followed by Local Governance and ICTs Research Network for Africa (LOG-IN Africa). This framework draws on existing literature on e-government, good governance, and results-based management. Data for the case study was collected through surveys, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and review of relevant documents in two municipal councils in Kenya. The focus was on the perspectives of consumers of the services provided by the councils. Data was analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The preliminary results show that the integrated financial management system implementation had modest improvements in most indicators of the following good governance constructs: participation, responsiveness, transparency, accountability, and efficiency and effectiveness. Given the modest improvements in good governance associated with the implementation of the system in the two municipal councils and the governance challenges in implementing a similar system in central government, the paper recommends, among other things, that local governments could be used to pilot complex e-governance initiatives and lessons learned used to scale up at national level."

This system allows governments to confront the problem of informality, tax evasion and social expenditure jointly, with important economies of scale, because the data or some personal information can be optimally used for both objectives increasing social benefits while decreasing costs. This system is about e-government inside the government itself. Hence it is concerned with E-management --- the use of information technology to improve the management of government, from streamlining business processes to maintaining electronic records, to improving the flow and integration of information."

The telecommunication facilities have improved remarkably. The academic institutions/universities producing ICT professionals/human resources have expanded. The communication technologies, both electronic and print media, have extended their access to general people. Uses of the Internet, emails and computers are gaining in popularity. Telecenters are widening their outreach. Several e-Government applications are being introduced. Noteworthy among the country's recent e-Government initiatives is Nepal's e-Government Master Plan, completed in November 2006. Another milestone is the preparation of an ICT Development Project which has worked out detailed investment proposals for prioritized projects. Negotiations are underway between the Government of Nepal and the Asian Development Bank for its financing and implementation arrangements. The Government of Nepal is, thus, keen and committed to promote e-Government for implementation of various G2G, G2C and G2B projects defined under respective priority areas. But the road to e-Government is not easy and straight. There are no doubt ample opportunities for national development through e-Government promotion. There are also several hurdles, problems and challenges which must be overcome for successful accomplishments of Nepal's e-Government vision. This paper endeavors to present a holistic vision on e-Government development of Nepal."
2007,E-governance in trade facilitation: transparency and ICT as prerequisites for free and fair trade,"Kimberley, Paul",Australia,customs; data standards; e-governance; interconnection; interoperability; single window; supply chain security; technical controls; trade; transparency,Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Theory and practice of electronic governance,10.1145/1328057.1328117,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?preflayout=flat&doid=1328057.1328117,Trade facilitation;Fair trade;Transparency (behavior);E-Governance;Information and communications technology;Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation;Customs;Import,3,606,"Trade facilitation is a generic term applied to the procedures and technologies used to integrate domestic trade into global supply chains. While there are other aspects to trade facilitation, ICT is becoming progressively more important. The objective of ICT in this context is to replace the paper documents, original signatures, cash payments and face-to-face meetings involved in obtaining import and export approvals from government agencies, and from Customs processes. This specific application of e-Government is crucially dependent upon effective e-Governance for transparency and efficiency. This paper discusses the importance of e-Governance mechanisms to free and fair trade, particularly through ICT interoperability and interconnectivity, data sharing through international standards, and process transparency. We illustrate the arguments by discussing the current global status of trade facilitation and the ""single window"" approach. One of the key lessons learned from successful trade facilitation implementations is the need to avoid ""agency-centric"" or ""silo"" approaches to systems reform. Trade facilitation, above all other e-Government initiatives, requires the cooperation of a sizeable proportion of Government agencies, in partnership with the private sector. Since trade facilitation is conditional upon local business practices and culture, best practice models are somewhat ethereal. Academic input is generally provided through international agency publications and projects. Private sector publications tend to be limited to product descriptions and case studies (See Appendix 2 for more details). The effectiveness of ICT in trade facilitation depends upon a pragmatic approach to what is technically and financially possible at a given stage of economic development and administrative reform. Hence this paper does not discuss specific ICT issues nor does it take an academic view: rather, it is a report on the current status of trade facilitation and the route that many countries-and some trade organisations, such as ASEAN and APEC- are taking towards a practical ICT-based single window initiative."

Fair, cheap and quick dispensation of justice is the prime responsibility of the government. In this context production of prisoners before the courts of law has always been a gigantic task for various agencies of the state. Some times, the Judges dealing with the matter have to visit jails to conduct trial there, which is commonly known as jail trial. But this is to be done at the cost of adjournments of many other cases, which are listed for the relevant date by the Judges or the Magistrates. It results in wastage of time, financial loss to the public as well as to the state. It also delays decision of other judicial matters. Production of hardened and desperate criminals after their apprehension before the courts of law for the purposes of their remand and trial has always been a problem for the investigating agencies and the state. Such criminals are usually linked with the gangs, who have a tendency to attack the police personnel during the transit to manage escape of their accomplices. Many events of this nature have already happened in the past, which sometime prove tragic and result in many causalities. Special arrangement for the production of such criminals burdens the state with financial loss. It also puts the personnel in danger with possible loss of valuable lives. In this era of terrorism and sectarian clashes, the terrorists as well as the fanatical individuals when booked become a gigantic task for the state to bring them before the Court. In past many tragic incidents have happened. A lot of machinery and financial resources are to be put-in, to observe the statutory provision while producing the terrorists and extremists before the Courts. Public disruption is another factor in such cases. There is another category of the prisoners, who are to be produced before the Courts for the purposes of extension in their judicial remand before submission of Challan. This category of prisoners infact constitute majority of the persons detained in jails. A lot of machinery, force and finance are required for their transportation from jail to the Courts and from Courts to the jail but no material progress is made in their matters due to emergency duty and protocol deployment of the police personnel. The production of prisoners and their trial through video conferencing system by using information technology (IT) and telecommunication technology can be a solution to such problems as well as a step towards good governance in developing countries like Pakistan. Through video links between jail and courts, the trial of the prisoners can be done without physical appearance in the Court, but it enables interaction between prisoner in Jail and concerned Judge, prosecutor, defense counsel and witnesses etc. present in the Court. This is not only a cost effective solution for police and district administration but will also enable speedy disposal of trial."

It also provides opportunities for the private sector, especially banks and investment houses, by creating wholly new financial services providers- Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) and Pension Fund Custodians (PFCs), with attendant growth in that industry and multiplier effects on the larger economy. The study concludes by suggesting new areas of innovation among service providers and variables which are amenable to manipulation by regulators to increase efficiency in the administration of pensions and ensure that the large army of current and prospective retirees enjoy - rather than endure- life in retirement."

The system has been developed to address the issues and problems related to Local Government. The system helps the stakeholders in policy making decisions on topics such as basic infrastructure development, assets planning, financial management and administrative functioning. The system not only caters to the District / Tehsil level issues but addresses issues related to the grass-roots level, i.e. Union Council and Revenue Estate. In short, the system caters for solutions and practices of electronic governance, and succeeds in effectively communicating its findings to different audiences. NARIMS is a complete software based system having an open-ended database with spatial representation. It consists of software, hardware, data and users elements, designed to meet specific planning and organizational goals. The data can be populated with attribute information pertaining to each local government department, thus creating an intelligent database related to a particular geographic area. Once the model is developed, it can be used by all applications that work with this object. Changes made to the model are automatically reflected in the applications, without any need to change application code. This makes the entire system more flexible and adaptable to changing business conditions and new technologies. Access to this type of information is extremely benificial to state, province, district, municipal agencies, researchers and general public. In addition, it can provide answers to questions that relate to economic growth, resource management, and public service delivery."

In fact, there is no doubt on the fact that establishing E-government systems can improve the quality of government services and enhance the citizens' life. However, E-government projects cannot be successful if they are not adapted to the specific cultural and social needs of the users. Taking into consideration the high illiteracy rate within the Moroccan population, we conducted our research to design an E-government portal for the old city of Fez that is accessible by the majority of the citizens especially those who are illiterate. The objective of this research is exploring the different architectures, scenarios and technologies for designing an E-government portal that is usable and accessible by all Fez citizens whether they are literate or illiterate. Hence, the concrete output of this project is a usable graphical user interface accessible to both literate and illiterate people in order for them to interact with the static content and to use the online transactions. In the process of achieving our goal, we had to discover and create design principles and to test them with real users. This paper describes and justifies the chosen methodology, architecture and tools that were applied in order to develop Fez e-government portal's graphical user interface. The results of the designed graphical user interface's testing are presented and discussed in order to assess the project's success."

Phase II (1984--1995): Personal Computer (PC)-based E-government, and 3. Phase III (1995--2007): Web-based E-government. The development of e-governance is assessed to find if the Indian experience in e-governance has lessons for developing countries. Five lessons are drawn. First, is the adoption of the strategy of self-reliance. Second is the investment in human resource development. Third is the creation of necessary information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure for e-government. Fourth is the redefinition of e-government to make it citizen-centric and not organization-centric. Lastly, providing a set of services to citizens at one e-government portal."

Its existence and prevalence act as major deterrence to societal achievements. Conflict for many is however, an inducer of human initiation of survival attempts, plans and policies. This is often coupled with the adaptation of mechanisms and possible innovation that serve to convert the pressure of conflict into a catalyst for human achievement in defiance of such pressure and consequent devastation. This paper will then look into ways that made ICT a tool for survival and life continuity under conflict. It will explore the different sectoral projects which were/ are still capable of utilizing human determination to facilitate the emergence of more connected societies whose fabric becomes consolidated with the Internet and information access as well as wider dissemination of ICT into citizen's lives even on the governance level! The paper will further project human attention in societies of conflict to ICT and the role ICT plays in bettering life quality. This will be verified by living examples from two countries deeply affected by years of wars and disputes. Such verification is to be supported by data and graphs. The paper will further show how e-governance is possible in conflict and how the e-transformation is achievable amongst societal ranks. It will therefore, attempt to devise methods to draw an inversely proportional connection between conflict and ICT dissemination."

Citizens, the world over, have been demanding smaller, effective and responsive governments, obviously inspired by the unprecedented and rapid success of finance capital in the global market. Consequently, policy makers began the search for smaller and efficient governments. On an evolutionary plane, reengineering of service systems, performance management, transparency in government operations, down sizing or right sizing the government workforce, emphasis on delivery of reliable public services and ultimately citizen satisfaction came to be considered as benchmarks by most of the administrators. Quick decision-making, data-based planning, effective implementation through quantitative techniques seemed to have clinched the issue. This reformative pattern was no different in the Indian context, where the governments at the federal and state levels were in search of new techniques and technologies. Information technology has been found to be very useful in reinvigorating the government administrative systems by enhancing their capacity and efficiency. The potential and scope for application of IT in governing processes and transactions are enormous. E-government can transform traditional administrative systems through employment of information and communication technologies. A governance system that is committed to working with civil society, and by extension, private industry in a transparent and accountable way to reduce poverty, redress imbalances in access to resources, foster security and uphold social, economic, cultural, civil and political rights is the ultimate objective of e-governance theory. In practice, much depends on the collaboration patterns that the governments seek to establish. E-governance practices in India emerged and evolved mainly from native intuition, but under prescription for lesser and transparent government by international financial institutions, mainly the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. However, the range of success of e-governance initiatives has not been uniform. The bottom-up demand for delivery of electronic services was bleak initially, but the change in public perception was for the better with the governments roping in private industry and service-oriented organizations gradually. The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model as is construed normally in a world that is fast witnessing globalization of all businesses and administrative trends, especially in the realm of e-governance, involves features such lesser government investment in electronic delivery of public services, collaboration in conceptualizing, designing and implementing the e-governance projects besides increased participation of stakeholders -- both private and public -- to saturate the levels and the reach of such projects. India is no exception to the general rule dictating PPP mode in e-governance. The unprecedented success of the PPP modules in e-governance in India can be rightly established with two path-breaking e-governance models - e-Seva in the state of Andhra Pradesh and Bhoomi in Karnataka. These projects not only caused a jump in revenue collections of the two state governments, but also timely payment by the citizens. Time and costs for availing public services have come down drastically bringing in a positive change in peoples' perception of e-governance theory and practice. This holds equally true for both the rural and urban populace. The result of all these radical changes in public administration systems is the enhanced satisfaction level of the citizenry on delivery of public services and simplification of governmental procedures. The above mentioned e-government projects can serve as models for all the developing societies."

In order to provide seamless integrated of information and services, Government of India launched National Portal of India two years back as a Mission Mode Project under the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) of Prime Minister of India. One of the mandates of the National Portal of India is to provide a platform for encouraging Citizens' Participation in the process of governance in the country. The Sixth Central Pay Commission, constituted by Government of India to revise the pay and perks of government employees, has leveraged on the initiatives of the National Portal of India to invite comments and suggestions in response to a questionnaire. This paper illustrates how the strength and reach of ICT can be leveraged to gather opinions from all stakeholders & citizens and enable them to participate in the process of governance."

It refers to a governmental type aimed at achieving effective service delivery from government to citizens, moving governance from traditionalist bureaucratization to modernist participatory administration. This paper is situated within the global experience, where many countries have advanced in their practice of e-governance and Nigeria, as a nation cannot relish in the disadvantages of being left behind in a globalizing world. We strongly propose that there is a significant relationship between a country's technological, political and bureaucratic advancement and a successful e-governance practice. This paper argues that with the present poor state of social infrastructure (especially power supply and road network) in Nigeria, the practice of e-governance is most likely to be negatively impacted upon. On this note, our paper recommends a re-assessment of the country's state of e-governance preparedness. It recommends the application of proactive steps aimed at ensuring the adequate supply of electricity and the development of human resource capabilities of the populace with the aim of achieving high-level computer literacy. The interval convocation of stakeholders at Abuja for talk-shops is not enough. Rather, Internet facilities and services must of necessity be made easily accessible at the lowest cost, to all Nigerians, irrespective of how remote their locations in the country may be. The world is on the move and Nigeria is an integral part of it, hence, should not lag behind."

We further discuss the value assumptions and implications, and propose an approach that will include value sensitive design as a way to address the designreality gap in order to minimize the risks for failure. In the process, a number of questions, issues and challenges are identified as possible foci for future research."

In fact, we postulate that there is a constant and necessary readjustment to be made between the trend towards technological innovation and the need for regulation and institutional acknowledgement and transformation. This co-evolutionary process goes far beyond the mere extension of government action onto non -State actors, as e-governance is too often understood. We see this process rather as a collective problem-solving dynamics, involving several types of stakeholders, among which, often, the State and its diverse representatives, but not only and by far, have to operate in a multi-level and open-ended space ICTs, in that type of process, are multi-faceted, sometimes just tools for productivity or communication, but sometimes also an industrial sector of its own, that has to be supported and regulated, as part of a critical series of structural change factors impacting our society. In this evolution, administrative services have been thought of, too often, as the main objective of e-governance, but we see now the need for an enhanced capability framework in policy-making and regulation, involving a broader mindset when it comes to use and regulate ICTs."

In practice, governments around the world have increasingly begun to explore the potential of FFA by equipping field crews with mobile technologies and applications. FFA in government promises substantial gains in crew productivity and information quality in on-site decision making. However, as in the case of other far-reaching technology-enabled changes in the past, FFA requires numerous technical, organizational, and social adjustments to reach the targeted potential. We have studied the case of a US city government that introduced FFA in its public utilities service units a while ago. While FFA lives up to promise in some areas, it does not so in others. Based on the analyses of the work context and the FFA uses, we have developed a set of recommendations for improving both the technical and organizational sides of the FFA approach. While some recommendations might be case-specific, others appear to apply to e-Government FFA in general. In this paper, we detail and discuss the choices that governments may face in FFA projects. The contribution of this paper is that it helps guide other FFA projects. The paper also adds to the academic understanding of the challenges and choices in e-Government FFA."

The project has recently published its final results. In this contribution, these results are summarized and reflected. The project performed an online survey among international experts to assess the importance of the thirteen research themes developed throughout the project. Results show that there are differences in the perception of the importance of a research theme in terms of geographical regions, level of development and stakeholder groups. Based on this discussion, further reflections address the needs and forms of action for fostering and implementing e-government research in the near future."

However, in a country like Palestine, with unstable economical and political situation, e-Government is thought at smaller scales through many decentralized initiatives. Most likely these initiatives are not coordinated or endorsed by a Central unit. This article combines theoretical frameworks [such as Balanced Scorecard, Enterprise Architecture and Strategic Management] and empirical experiences to design a model to enable the data flow between decentralized local government units (LGUs) and central government. The Model illustrates the usefulness of adopting a top-down approach across the five layers of the Enterprise Architecture to develop a cross-agency, multipurpose and multi-layer data model using standard XML domain schemas"

Thus two cases in Africa, Cape Verde, a small island of 500,000 inhabitants off the coast of Senegal in west Africa and South Africa, an emerging African country of 40 million inhabitants demonstrate that following the example of many governments around the world, Information and communication technologies have been used in the last decades to improve public service delivery and the operations of government. While these so called e-Government programs have started to yield significant benefits in terms of convenience, efficiency and service quality for citizens, businesses and public agencies alike, new trends are emerging which involve more than applying the technologies than promoting social and economic inclusiveness and furthering participation and democracy at large. This paper elaborates on key lessons learnt from Cape Verde and South Africa on the one hand, and envisages how those two countries and the African continent could still harness the new opportunities for deepening reform in public service delivery and citizen engagement on the other hand."

Access to these areas is mostly by foot, several days from the nearest road head; infrastructure and basic services such as government, health and education-related services are negligible. Despite the government's ambitious plans and policies to improve access to ICT services to the rural population, including some e-governance services, ICT deployment and use has remained minimal outside urban centers. Unlike urban Internet Cafes, rural telecenters in Nepal are challenged by low user literacy and information use potential, and limited revenue generation possibilities. They need support to realize the larger objectives of e-governance, e-health and e-commerce. Several modes of increasing access to e-services have been tried with minimal success. Outlined below is an approach that provides internet services to rural users linked to some life-enhancing information that impacts their daily life directly. The Information and Communication Technology Global Development Alliance (ICT GDA) is a partnership between Mercantile Communications Private Limited and Winrock International-Nepal. This activity facilitates overall community mobilization by providing services through ICT telecenters to improve rural connectivity through the use of telephony, internet email and related services. The project provides connectivity through VSAT and is among the first non-commercial venture to extend connectivity through Wi-Fi networks, creating local loops in remote areas. The project has built partnerships with principle stakeholders in the field of ICT promotion in Nepal, both government and private sector. Multisectoral linkages between e-governance and other services have been established through relevant local bodies, organizations in the development sector, and communities in order to deliver fast and reliable services to achieve universal objectives pertaining to poverty alleviation, education, health and hygiene."

MIS itself draws on fields such as Computer Science, Economics, Sociology, etc. The theory and methods that any e-governance researcher will rely on will be determined by the problems being addressed and the context in which the problems arise. This tutorial workshop presents an overview of theory used in e-governance research. It then presents an introduction to two richly developed theories in MIS namely - Structuration and Actor-Network theory. The presentations highlight the main ideas of these theories with a view to prompting their increased incorporation in e-governance research. E-governance issues for developing countries is also presented, as these constitute a growing area of research. The workshop features three papers that will form the basis for a discussion on state-of-the-art in e-governance theory."

Electronic governance, or the facilitation of governance through ICT and related tools, provides a unique opportunity for reassessment of the traditional methods, processes, and outputs of the public sector. This paper addresses some of these key opportunities and the challenges that accompany them. Practically and concretely, this paper intends to provide support to policy makers by addressing the challenges of developing a strategy for implementation of change towards governance structures that recognise the need to improve participatory methods in policy making whilst also assuring that exclusion - of a digital nature or otherwise - does not render the process counter-productive. It will raise questions of representativeness, meaningfulness, the role of existing institutional elements in current governmental structures, and the question of political will for moving towards a governance that makes use of ICT-based means. First, we shall address the results and implications of the electronic government debate and outline the challenges that still remain. This will include a stock-taking exercise in the domain of e-government, which builds upon exiting literature in the field, notably the UN Global E-government Readiness Reports as well as thinking towards future research agendas for e-governance, which shall enable us, in Part 3, to move on to discuss innovations in governance, through an analysis of the concept in a liberal democratic context. The fourth part of the paper will address new tools and applications and how they can encourage change in public sector governance."

This paper shows how e-Government employs wide range of theories, techniques, methodologies, models, and frameworks to understand and construct solutions and implement them in a specific context. Then argues that e-Government as a ""multidisciplinary overarching system"" employs knowledge from applied science, pure science and engineering to adapt to the context it operates in. The paper envisages the possibility of generalizing e-Government knowledge areas based on the large magnitude of reusable knowledge, which are identified through a pattern recognition process and through knowledge mapping techniques. Patterns and knowledge maps are used to show that e-Government is not fuzzy and that its design and implementation follow a logical process, which could be abstracted and generalized across many nations. This paper gives a preliminary framework to construct the e-Government informatics discipline with an aim to qualify people to lead the initiatives of e-Government."

The post World War II decades were treated with arguments that utilized protechnology thinking as a kind of missing link in the then development agenda. However, the rise of neo -classical school from the 1980's onwards has altered the technology-development landscape, by introducing untraditional sets of institutional relations-in particular, reduction of the state, expansion of markets and generally curtailing the civil society. Electronic governance has ascended the world stage from within the neo-classical order. The implications being that market systems define the rules of the game as far as e-Governance operations are concerned. Inevitably, the expansive power allocated to markets by the neo-classical order has generated different forms of regulation, aimed at addressing social polarization. The need for regulation has long been advocated for, by Keynesian and other renowned theorists. By interrogating these sorts of issues, this paper established that e-Governance negotiates poorly with social goals in particular forms of regimes. In details, the study found that market economies with high levels of e-Governance registers high inequality levels, while mixed or social democracies on medium levels of e-Governance record better trends of social equality. Many developing countries fall under market economies, not by choice, but largely due to dysfunctional bureaucracies. The argument being that when bureaucracies dysfunction, market systems naturally take charge. On the above account, the study proposed that e-Governance could operate far better in social terms, if it is compartmentalized. It also suggested that e-Governance target human development initiatives at earlier rather than late stages."

Web application firewalls (WAF) are the most important tool to secure web applications against the increasing number of web application attacks nowadays. WAFs work in different modes depending on the web traffic filtering approach used, such as positive security mode, negative security mode, session-based mode, or mixed modes. The proposed WAF, which is called (HiWAF), is a web application firewall that works in three modes: positive, negative and session based security modes. The new approach that distinguishes this WAF among other WAFs is that it utilizes the concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI) instead of regular expressions or other traditional pattern matching techniques as its filtering engine. Both artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic concepts will be used to implement a hybrid intelligent web application firewall that works in three security modes."

Most of the approaches described so far deal with automatic web service discovery used by software agents. This paper focuses on the use of semantic technologies to support citizens when interacting with e-Government sites. Our experience has shown, that sometimes identifying the appropriate service that is needed to accomplish a tasks can require some in-depth knowledge of existing regulations. To overcome this potential barrier we suggest a relatively simple approach based on the use of ontologies to support citizens to select the correct administrative service. Our approach assists a citizen in formally expressing a goal that can in turn be used for service discovery. This is done by introducing some guidelines and constraints on the model; while this process can be simplified the complexity can be hidden from the user."

A key, technological challenge in electronic governance is to ensure that the meaning of data items is accurately recorded, and accessible in an economical---effectively, automatic---fashion. In response, a variety of data and metadata standards have been put forward: from government departments, from industry groups, and from organisations such as the ISO and W3C. This paper shows how the leading standard for metadata registration---ISO 11179---can be deployed without the need for a single, monolithic conceptualisation of the domain, and hence without the need for universal agreement upon a particular model of electronic governance. The advantages of this approach are discussed with regard to the UK eGovernment Interoperability Framework (eGIF) and the UK Integrated Public Sector Vocabulary (IPSV)."

Financial Instruments and Exchange Law is promulgated on June 14th, 2006, to impose documentation of financial reporting on Japanese listed companies. To document financial reporting, each company has to evaluate control activities in administrative work-flows. Evaluation is to check if control activities in administrative workflows prevent or mitigate latent risks properly. The decision-making criteria for evaluation depend on the evaluator and are not seen explicitly. This causes lack of consistency of evaluation. To avoid inconsistency, the decision-making criteria for the evaluation should be specified precisely. In this paper, we propose a decision-making criterion for evaluation and show how evaluation can be done with it. Evaluation with precisely defined decision-making criteria raises reliability of financial reporting. This research is helpful to construct an e-Government system for evaluations of business processes for Internal Control."

However, many e-Governments are developed without fully supporting the real government needs and sufficient quality. This paper pointes out three well-known quality aspects, i.e. process quality, information quality and service quality that can be embedded into e-Government. The imperial work on proving e-Government quality is addressed. In addition, the sustainable e-Government development containing four main components, i.e. stakeholder, development methodology, information and communication technology, and environment, is discussed. Integrating the above concepts, the quality framework of e-Government development to guarantee governmental and citizens' usage and satisfaction is established."

However, the current European public e-Procurement infrastructure is inappropriate because it is characterized through a high market fragmentation and a lack of interoperability. To facilitate EU-wide interoperability in public e-Procurement the European Commission co-funds the PEPPOL (Pan-European Public Procurement On-Line) project within the Competitive Innovation Programme (CIP) Framework. PEPPOL aims at setting up pan-European pilot solutions that conjointly exist with national infrastructures. The project consists of several building blocks for e-Procurement that cover the entire e-Procurement process from pre-awarding to post-awarding. One of the key building blocks for the pre-awarding phase is the Virtual Company Dossier (VCD), an electronic cross-border document container that carries certificates and attestations required for the qualitative selection of tenderers. In this paper, we introduce findings from existing studies for designing a VCD, such as a feasibility study on Electronic Business Attestation and VCD related European legislations (e.g. Directive 2004/17/EC & Directive 2004/18/EC). Moreover we sketch the approach taken in the PEPPOL project to design pilots in two Member States."

However, to realize adaptive, transparent, accountable, efficient and agile government providing demand-driven service provisioning at low cost, more radical changes are needed. In this light therefore, transformational government has often been identified as the next challenge for e-government. This tutorial and workshop are aimed at contributing to the understanding of the scope of the issues in transformational government and approaches to transformation. In the tutorial an overview of transformational government basics is given which covers the whole range, from governance and organization to technology and implementation. During the workshop four papers will be presented, complemented by a discussion of the transformational aspects of e-governments. The papers consider a devolution reference model for e-governance, adaptability through strategic IT planning, and applications linked to community-based poverty reduction and tax administration."

Therein, the strategic planning process, plan execution, and routine daily tasks are carried out, conceptually, in the same manner. Furthermore, the plans themselves may be reconfigured or modified according to changing organisational and architectural models for IT activities. The work assumes a formal model of time that enables one to track institutional transformations over time. Hence, the model underpins IT governance issues and tool support to investigate possible future scenarios of what could happen, analyse past activities of what happened, or just perform routine duties."

Simultaneously, the model enables government to improve programme implementation by identifying opportunities for infrastructure-sharing among contiguous communities, identifying optimal financial resource and risks combination in a cost-efficient manner as well as undertaking monitoring and evaluation of project implementation. It concludes that the citizens would be better off if this technology is deployed in a measured and coordinated way, further leading to the emergence of model e-communities in Nigeria."

It appears that most of problems related with transformation of business into e-business and government into e-government are quite similar in different countries independently of the level of their development. The aim of this tutorial is to discuss the strategic impact of e-government on economy and society. In the tutorial, e-Government is seen as a lever to e-economy providing young people finishing schools and universities with a possibility to create job in innovative enterprises offering e-content and e-services for both private and public sectors. The tutorial also discusses conditions under which transformation of traditional government into e-government may contribute to cutting costs of administration and improving its efficiency. The main aim of the workshop is to share experiences of people involved in e-government solutions development and deployment. The workshop provides an opportunity of mutual inspiration on problem solving provided by people coming from different developing countries."

An assessment from two states in the South Western part of Nigeria regarding the awareness, use and sustainability of e-Governance in Nigeria was carried out. The perspectives of the government staff as well as other users (non-government staff) were assessed. It was found that 68% of both government employees (GE) and non-government employees (NGEs) are aware of e-Governance in the states, and the governments have achieved this high rate of awareness by means of mass media (30%). Computer literacy amongst employees is put at 19 users out of every 20, and 52% of those that are computer literate have over 3yrs experience in using the computer. Also, 76.6% are reported to have access to the Internet and only 31.3% of those that have access to the Internet have access points in their offices. Proficiency about the use of e-Governance resources was also tested, it was found that about 50% of the users are proficient and about 35% of them use the Internet on a daily basis. Challenges about the e-Governance resource were also discussed and appropriate policy directions are advanced for a better use and its sustainability."

Advancements in technologies coupled with globalization efforts have allowed such property to easily cross geographical boundaries. Various international treaties and national laws have been set in place to ensure intellectual property owners of their rights. This paper reports the results of an exploratory investigation into the major challenges and returns resulting from the implementation of a national copyright law in Jordan. The paper begins by providing the reader with an overview of Jordan in relation to copyrights. This study relied on both primary and secondary data. The challenges associated with such a law were categorized into implementation, cultural, and socio-economic factors. Respondents identified monetary returns, strategic outcomes, and creative stimulation as key returns resulting from enforcing the law. Finally, the data illustrated that public education and awareness campaigns, and training programs are essential to the success of such a law."

Such a framework is particularly required in the areas where public governance seeks technology support, as is the case for Electronic Governance (e-Governance). This paper explains the need to put in place a comprehensive set of policies, and presents a model for policy interventions supporting e-Governance development. The model comprises a classification of policies based on their nature and applicability, and describes core areas for which policy interventions are required. The paper also presents three major scenarios for using the model: (1) a tool to help design and analyze critical policy interventions by developing and transition nations, (2) a template to understand different alternatives for interventions, and (3) a checklist to review all niche areas to be regulated. In particular, applicability of the model in India is discussed."

In China, various kinds of DG projects mushroomed all over the country. In addition, financial expenditure put in this field was estimated at no less than 5 billion dollars annually. Because USA is birthplace of ICT and Digital Government, many Chinese scholars and officers took on USA as the model of China. Some criticized the digital government in China by using the case of USA as a criterion. Others suggested that China should transplant some experiences of USA directly. However, the experience from USA does not work well in the practice of China. For example, CIO in government, which was an idea initiated in USA, has not found its seat in Chinese Governments till now. The author of this paper believes that the reasons for such a transfer to fail are great differences between these two countries in the field of political mechanism. Differences existing in the political system and administration are the fundamental reasons resulting in various patterns of DG. For example, in decentralized countries, Digital Government systems are usually established by local governments at different levels. These systems are usually small and have no interactive links between each other. However, in the countries with centralization of administrative power, DG projects are usually established as integrated systems within a country or a province, with relatively large scale and interactive links more conveniently accessible for governments at different levels, although their application is still far from the ideal in the actual operation. This article reports the results of research on the influence of the political systems and administrations over DG on the basis of United States of America and China, and puts forward a hypothesis how the political mechanism influences DG. This research was supported by the Education Ministry of China, under the project 07JZD0019."

The paper identifies four barriers to promoting access rights and points to success stories from around the world suggesting how these barriers might be overcome. Much of the paper is based on ""Voice & Choice: Opening the Door to Environmental Democracy"" published in 2008 by the World Resources Institute. The paper also briefly examines recent research findings that concern access rights for the poor and e-Governance."

Numerous governments are considering mandating either or both formats for their electronic documents. For ODF, the dominant implementation is OpenOffice.org and for OOXML, the dominant implementation is Microsoft Office. This research scores the performance of other alternative implementations for ODF and OOXML. The goal is to assess the current state of interoperability for document formats. The results show that there are no alternative implementations, for either ODF or OOXML, that offer 100% compatibility with the dominant implementations. The results are troubling and suggest the need for improved interoperability testing. Without such testing, governments will be locked-in into the dominant implementations for either standard."

The balanced scorecard---already a widely recognized management best-practice---is well-suited both as a framework for this imperative, and as a mechanism for knowledge-sharing between industry and public sector managers. First, a balanced scorecard initiative must embrace a multi-disciplinary, multi-stakeholder and community-oriented approach, taking into account the needs of diverse constituencies. Second, public sector e-Government leaders can benefit from the same robust perspective on learning, innovation, and customer satisfaction in addition to financial measures that the balanced scorecard has brought to private sector managers. This paper shares the experience of one commercial company (Microsoft Corporation) taking a balanced scorecard approach to open source policy and strategy development, and offers an analysis of implications and opportunities for e-Government leaders."

High-caliber decisions require a clear-sighted, non-dogmatic grasp of the contexts in which government enterprises today deploy both proprietary and open-source software in heterogeneous IT environments. This article addresses the topic, and describes ways in which proprietary and open-source software developers are drawing upon each other's development, licensing and business models. The article illustrates how today's IT world is no longer an ""either/or"" world in which customers and vendors chose to be either proprietary or open source. Instead, it is an attractive world of ""both/and"" as the lines between proprietary and open source have, making interoperable deployments almost inevitable in many if not most cases."

A case study shows the migration and implementation of a lead e-government application in the Austrian federal administration, where records management and workflows were previously operating independently in government agencies. Harmonization has been accomplished via a directed outsourcing decision which also supported the process of harmonizing IT governance. Sourcing design has proven to be crucial in that case, as several stakeholders presented different principle objectives. The approach of the outsourcing decision within the case study is analyzed by examining the decision process and interviewing major participants of the project."

This study is based on personal interview of selected representatives of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi and review of e-Governance initiatives taken by the government. The findings of this study highlight the role of Internet, particularly the World Wide Web (WWW), which has made it easier for citizens to locate and download official information and to conduct transactions. We conclude that e-Governance needs to be integrated into the broader public management framework so as to make a substantial change in the government to citizen (G2C) relationship."

Nowadays, the fall in IT prices, the development of innovative IT solutions and the rise in IT literacy in a number of countries has, at least tackled the latter issue. However, people still are not as enthusiastic, as it was envisaged by technocrats and politicians, in using IT solutions to pass from e-Government to e-Governance, a notable example of which is e-Voting. In this paper we argue that efforts to introduce complex e-Government and e-Participation applications should be gradual and develop solutions hand-in-hand with in-field trials that increase (also gradually) in complexity and people inclusiveness, so as to handle the various forms of social inertia successfully. We present our experience in the e-Voting domain and suggest that a similar approach in e-Voting (and other demanding e-Government/e-Participation applications) could fare better to success than introducing to people a system that suddenly appears and claims to be the ""perfect"", all-in-one, solution."

Firstly, networked register terminals replaced paper registers. Secondly, the networked register formed the basis of enabling single-vote access for poll-place electronic voting. Finally, poll place electronic voting machines were provided as stateless thin clients who were networked for real-time central aggregation of votes. A central server was charged with the coordination of 400 such voting and register machines at 64 sites. Register terminals also formed the basis of recording the issue of paper votes if the voter so chose, as these were provided to allow voting in the traditional manner. In concert with these systems, votes were also collected via telephone and web-based remote electronic voting services. The pilot has been judged a success by the central government."

This study was designed to investigate the quantitative and qualitative information about health related websites in Sri Lanka. Google and Yahoo search engines were used to search for Sri Lankan health websites. The key words used were 'Sri Lanka health', 'Sri Lanka medicine', Sri Lanka drug', 'Sri Lanka treatment'. Ninety eight websites were selected and data collected from 86 of these websites which were online during the period of data collection. Results show that 87.2% of websites contained less than 100 web pages. 39.5% and 20.9% of websites were owned by local non-business organizations and business organizations, respectively while 61.6% of websites were non-profitable websites. 93% of the websites were published only in English. Only 8.1% of websites provide health educational content for general public as their main content. 64.4% of websites are controlled by a Sri Lankan or a Sri Lankan organization. Quality Score is higher in the websites owned by local non-business organizations over the business organizations as well as non-profitable websites over profitable websites. Quality Score of the websites does not depend on the period of existence or whether website originated from Sri Lanka. We conclude that the total number of websites has not increased compared to the increase in internet usage during last few years in Sri Lanka. Internet is an underutilized health education tool despite the rapid growth of internet usage in Sri Lanka. Even though Internet usage has grown rapidly in most developing countries, dissemination of health information through internet may not have been developed adequately in such countries."

Government functions are the most profound areas where ICT can play a pivotal role in fostering and ameliorating citizen centric services. Adaptation of e-Governance is a key for smart governance and making information technology (IT) relevant to ordinary citizens in Bangladesh where a large proportion of the population suffers from digital divide. e-Governance will allow ordinary people to interact with the government at various levels on matters of governance to provide inputs for decision makers. To achieve these desired objectives the journey for establishing e-Governance system in Bangladesh faced challenges that can be summarized by three A's: Access, Awareness and Applications. Being a developing country, it was always a challenge for the country to finance capital intensive endeavours like access backbones and communication infrastructure. Also, newer ICT tools remained beyond the purchasing power of most Bangladeshis. With the proliferation of mobile, while the communication infrastructure challenge is somewhat resolved, the issues of awareness among the public servants and citizen are still low. Such awareness (or lack of it) among middle and senior public officials remained a particular of concern in the context of establishing e-Governance. This paper presents a baseline assessment of existing capacity, needs and options for implementing e-Governance in Bangladesh."

One of the critical areas where there is duplication of infrastructure and manpower in e-governance is the data center. There are several approaches to e-Governance but most of them require the different government agencies to procure and maintain the entire IT infrastructure themselves. Utility Based Computing (UBC) offers tremendous potential to develop a sustainable e-Governance framework wherein a common data center infrastructure can be setup to provide the e-governance solutions, with different departments being billed as per the usage of the infrastructure. The combined potential of UBC to deliver computing on demand and to pay as you go paradigm offer a new approach to deliver cost-effective and efficient governance to the citizens. However, this framework has also its risks and issues."

Existing languages for representing test cases demonstrate specific weaknesses. This paper identifies these weaknesses and proposes a sequence of steps for the definition of test cases and a XML representation of them based on the XML Requirement and Test language (XRT).

These components may be locally developed, managed and optimized and not intended to be reused in composite applications. By compositing modular components in new systems large, distributed systems can be developed in which services provided by various stakeholders are combined. The creation of service compositions is an ill-posed and ill-structured design problem which must be tackled with great care and should take into account the various stakeholders and their technological systems. In this paper we present a socio-technical design approach for developing service compositions. This approach starts with analyzing both user requirements and analyzing available services. This is in contrast with existing approaches, which are primarily supply-driven, i.e. they take the available services as a starting point. In addition, the individual service components need to be coordinated to create a coherent composition. Therefore, the dependencies among components are analyzed which help to identify feasible and alternative compositions and enable communication and negotiation among stakeholders. We found that the dependencies among systems components are often viewed as simple sequential, connections whereas, they might not be. Moreover, it was found that a method focused on technical design alone, like most current composition approach, will be insufficient and that stakeholder-related social aspects need to be considered. A service compositions approach in organizational networks requires a high degree of stakeholder participation."

Despite using mature technological approaches, the implementation issues can only be addressed using organizational frameworks with an information systems focus. A joint venture between a telecommunications company and local authorities in the UK has provided a case study for exploration of the role of post-graduate education as an intervention in organizational transformation. This approach identifies and suggests initiatives that involve meeting and addressing the different demands of stakeholders. Data collection has been carried out through qualitative methods of interviews and participant observation. In addition, action research has been used to explore the perceptions and learning of the students in this case study. The outcome has indicated the paradigms of the two groups involved in the case study. It has revealed further research questions to be addressed in the implementation of e-Government at both local and national levels in the UK and, we expect, the wider world."

This development cannot be ignored by the public sector, because Web 2.0 can take the evolution of E-Government in new directions. This paper discusses the impact of (local) Web 2.0 applications on the further development of E-government. Web 2.0 applications have much potential for the public sector in terms of interaction, participation and transparency. However, examples of websites with transaction or transformation characteristics are rare. For that reason it is too early to speak about a virtual state. In order to realize these two final stages of E-Government, it is important to take into account the potential risks of Web 2.0 applications as well, like isolation, exclusion, violation of privacy and misuse of information."

At the moment e-Participation happens in political niche arenas and does not have real impact or importance on political decision-making. Activists and researchers promote the field of e-Participation but not the institutional political system. Thus no coherent strategies or public policies exist by political bodies at federal or state level. The e-Participation experiments practically show the options and risks of innovations of the political system in regard to better represent or empower the citizens but do not allow a generalization of the often somewhat sobering results. Currently the German federal government shows rising awareness for e-Participation but sees it as an integrated part of a representative e-Government. Driving forces of innovation, the political system towards e-Participation comprises activists and civil society movements simply using web 2.0 tools and techniques for their purposes: better organization, rising awareness and gaining power."

For instance Africa lags behind other continents in e-Government efforts and related achievements, evidenced in low scores reported by the United Nations global readiness surveys and related index[6]. One issue emerging from e-Government practices and crucial in bridging the digital divide regionally is the need for ""Back office"" automation or ""integration"". Known as connected governance, it is a critical enabler transforming capabilities and delivering far-reaching benefits. The lack of connected governance in the developing world is a disturbing and challenging issue. This article presents the eFez project from Morocco, a case study outlining the lessons learned in back office integration."

These challenges are serious in a context where there is an absence of appropriate organizational and institutional structures to deal with incidents. But more important which agency or agencies should be given the responsibility for computer security, is the point that some national leadership should be designated to ensure that computer security will receive government-wide attention. Therefore, sectors and lead agencies should assess the reliability, vulnerability, and threat environments of the infrastructures and employ appropriate protective measures and responses to safeguard them. The ITU has already proposed a whole process for developing and implementing a national Cyber security plan [1]. This process requires a comprehensive strategy that includes an initial broad review of the adequacy of current national practices, and consideration of the role of all stakeholders. This paper proposes a global framework answering the former needs expressed by the ITU. It is intended to present « ncsec », the « National Cyber security Referential », which is a guide for the development of « National Cyber security standards and effective Cyber security Management » for the creation of National Organizational Structures and Policies on Cybercrime at the national level, in order to help building regional and international cooperation for watch, warning, and incident response. We can notice a great relationship between our proposal and ISO27002 standard."

Although e-government websites are provided by all local councils it appears that their level of use is still low and only few of them are fully transactional. The low level of user involvement is a significant factor for the low uptake of e-government websites by citizens. Therefore, it is worth investigating further how different government websites in the UK have addressed the issue of user involvement through the various features provided to potential users in their websites. The findings of the research reported here emphasize the crucial importance of user involvement -- in this case citizen engagement -- in the design, development and evolution of local e-Government systems."

However, although governments around the globe have made enormous investments in e-Government initiatives, whether these efforts do indeed promote greater civic engagement is still under fierce debate between those optimistic and those pessimistic about technology's potential to change the way governments interact with the populace. This paper attempts to figure out whether the Internet can encourage civic engagement and whether its effect is ""reinforcing"" or ""mobilizing"" by analyzing Taiwanese national survey data. The findings show that ICTs appear to have a reinforcing, rather than mobilizing effect. These technologies encourage only those people who are already active in so-called real-world civic engagements to interact with their governments online. At the end of this paper, four policy recommendations are proposed, namely: (1) keeping spending resources that could engage people in ways other than technology; (2) allocating more resources to address the digital divide; (3) focusing future e-Government initiatives in Taiwan more strongly on users; and (4) including a synchronized reform in these initiatives between the online interface and offline back-office."

Although there are many readiness assessment instruments in the public domain, there are no clear guidelines on how these instruments can be reused as frameworks in carrying out assessment in specific contexts, such as in e-government planning or implementation. The design of readiness assessment frameworks requires clear specification of the assessment purpose and the design of concrete instruments explicitly based on the information requirements. Usually, these information needs are modular and can be satisfied by any instrument composed from the required set of assessment components. In this paper, we examine the requirements for a readiness assessment framework to support e-government planning and propose an assessment framework consisting of a set of assessment perspectives. Each of these perspectives is mapped to a corresponding set of concrete assessment components (partly derived from other major e-government assessment frameworks) satisfying the information requirements of these perspectives. The componentized framework allows for easy substitution or specialization of specific components to suit different contexts or assessment scenarios. As an example, we show how this framework can be used for developing a readiness assessment instrument to support e-government planning in Maldives."

Countries are often ranked with respect to, among other things, their economic, human, and technological development. Benchmarking tools such as the e-Government index serve as useful tools for policy makers. Given the importance any benchmarking and ranking is given when devising policies regarding information and communication technologies and allocating resources to implement those technologies by institutions and countries, an objective framework to produce the rankings is paramount. A ranking is as good as the frameworks used to produce it. Despite their wider use, some of the current procedures used for e-Government index computation have limitations. For instance, they do not differentiate between websites that provide static information and fully fledged portals. This paper compares four frameworks, points out their limitations and strengths, and proposes ways to address their limitations."

UN claims eGRI to be a true global ranking programmatic tool. It measures relative indices of UN's Member States with respect to each other for the particular year as well as their own positions with respect to the past years, thereby portraying evolving patterns of Member States' e-Government performance. Over a period of time, feedback from ongoing process of e-Readiness evaluation and a number of resources accumulating UN's knowledge base about e-Government have helped to shift the focus of these surveys from measuring ""investments made in deployment of information and communication technologies (ICT)"" to ""the degree of connectedness in terms of back office information integration for efficient ways of offering e-Governance."" Assumptions made while designing issue-based UN Surveys pose a series of limitations in terms of interpreting the results. However, eGRI can be definitely used effectively by Member States for human development through technologies in respective parts of the world. UN's advocacy for building a skilled human capital for a future knowledge-based society is one of the valuable offerings made by these Surveys. Socio-economic uplifting of citizens through ICT and the principle of ""inclusion for all"" offer a strong guiding framework for Member States to craft related policies, design large scale ICT-led projects and deployment of ICT in the future. Since all the imperatives, rankings, views and suggestions expressed by UN through these Surveys are highly ""context"" dependent, failure to understand this core principle could take governments off the fundamental path of ""inclusion for all."" Devising a risk-to-reward index, trust index and citizen satisfaction index are some of the possible ways to better inform e-Readiness Index in the future."

We elaborate the use of the PACE toolkit, as a qualitative tool for the visualization of the impact of EU research and innovation projects on ICT, by compiling an Inventory of Regional Assets, through a battery of interviews performed in the 10 selected regions. This paper elaborates on the value of increasing involvement of government organizations (like Public Administrations) in ICT research and innovation projects. It is really interesting, for example, to see that the direct value of acquisition of new ideas, approaches and knowledge by a government organization, can affect the regional policy on promoting innovation and creating a more competitive environment inside the region therefore generating the interest for external investment."

The Government is making efforts for successful implementation of this plan. E-revenue administration is one of the systems dedicated to provide quality services to the public; specifically the tax payers using IT as a major tool. Inland Revenue Department (IRD) of Government of Nepal is the agency responsible for the implementation of the e-Revenue Administration. IRD is primarily responsible for enforcement of Tax Laws, administration and monitoring the non-tax revenues of the Government of Nepal. The e-Revenue Administration initiative of the IRD commenced in 2006 has produced successful ICT projects with resulting applications enjoying significant citizen uptake. These applications include: e-PAN (Electronic Permanent Account Number) System; Value Added Tax (VAT) Assessment/Collection; Income Tax Assessment/Collection Services; Revenue Accounting System (RAS); e-Estimated Income Tax Return System; Check point Entry System; Third Party data including import data from customs and SMS System. This paper presents an overview of these initiatives, briefly highlights success factors and comments on improvement."

These models are creative and systematic methods undertaken by governments to enhance policy quality and administrative services based on e-Government. This paper aims to review these models and investigate related critical success factors. In this work, the different models were revived and their limitations were identified. By integrating and adding some new factors, we discussed about the 9 CSFs which are considered more useful for implementing EPS based on knowledge management systems which focus on the management of information resources. The objective of this paper is to show how EPS can follow path for achieving the needs for establishing Knowledge-Based Management System (KBMS) in this domain. The final set of CSFs and the integrated model show they can act as a list of items and an easy method for modeling EPS based on a knowledge focused system."

In order to bring this region to the main stream, the Government of India in 2002 set up 555 Community Information Centres (CICs) at the block level. The CICs provide digital communication including e-governance services. After five years of operation, the CICs are in the process of merging with Common Services Centres (CSCs). The CSCs scheme entails public-private partnership and the available services go beyond e-governance to commercial services like bill payment etc. After merging with CSCs, the yeoman service being done by CICs for the local community would be continued. The project demonstrates that ICT can play a major catalytic role in socio-economic development as well as empowerment of people at the grass root level."

However, the vast majority of the world still seems to remain oblivious to connectivity and its vital role towards helping in providing faster economic progress. Still today, developing countries regard this field of technology as too expensive to expand. Therefore, we are compelled to believe that a more affordable solution is needed. ICT is relatively less expensive technology and so would solve many of the problems of the poor regions; especially in rural villages. Its expansion may have far-reaching effects on reducing poverty and Bridging the Digital Divide, like cell phones which creates a way through to bring an end to this technological gap. The aim of this paper is to explore the role of the telecommunication sector for bridging the so-called digital divide."

This is evident from the major role that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has played in rebuilding post-conflict states. The panel argues that fragility and huge developmental challenges should not impede innovations in the area of ICT which could in fact accelerate development and reconstruction efforts. Therefore, we contend that no matter how volatile a country is ICT should not be viewed as a luxury. On the contrary, ICT-related development would be even more pertinent to societies in turmoil, war-torn areas, and in countries experiencing hardships of existence, civil unrest political strife and lack of democracy. The panel will discuss the role that electronic governance in the rebuilding or reconstruction efforts in post-conflict states, particularly in the area of strengthening the governance system, rebuilding citizens' trust and enabling national reconciliation -- through better interaction and dialog between different stakeholders and the government. In particular, it will also discuss how traditional approach to e-governance can be customized to better support structural programs that are part of state building, in view of expected prevailing austerity measures in the area of resource allocation."

Interoperability means the ability of ICT systems and of business processes they support to exchange data and to enable the sharing of information and knowledge. To help achieve interoperability, both within and across different policy areas, many countries have developed their own interoperability frameworks. However, in spite of the recommendations and guidelines provided by these frameworks, issues such as socio-economic disparities between regions challenge their effective and successful use. This panel will explore several key questions concerning success factors for an interoperability program from various perspectives, including: 1) When are organizations ready to think of running an interoperability initiative? 2) The actions the organization must take to ensure that the process is established and will endure. 3) Preconditions that must exist in the organization to implement interoperability (eventually through a framework). 4) Roles and procedures necessary to implement an interoperability program. 5) Is it possible to start an interoperability program in under-resourced administrations?

The paper claimed that 85% of e-Government projects in developing countries fail; out of which 35% are total failures, 50% are partial failures, and only 15% are successes. Soon thereafter, the World Bank reported in a ""Task Managers' ICT Toolkit"" that its sectoral based projects with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) components had an ""alarmingly high failure rate"", with 50% suffering disputes and 80% requiring contract amendments. It would seem that a lot of e-Government/ICT projects aimed at rural areas can waste precious resources that could be devoted to competing development needs. This panel is twofold. First, reasons of lack of sustainable e-Government initiatives in rural communities will be discussed. Second, successful projects presenting examples of good practices will be analyzed in order to summarize lessons to be learned."

Citizen journalism, on the other hand is the act of citizens playing an active role in the process of collecting, reporting, analyzing and disseminating news and information. The intent of this participation is to provide independent, reliable, accurate, wide-ranging and relevant information that a democracy and governance requires. If e-Governance is still the top-down flow of information, then citizen journalism is a bottom-up flow. However, in both -- on e-Governance through the state, and on citizen journalism through the citizens; the quantum of practices has grown in leaps and bounds with the rapid penetration of new media technologies, like the Internet in the economic, social, political and other processes. The soul searching still needs to be done on do e-Governance and citizen journalism flock together? Can e-Governance facilitate and integrate bottom-up flow of information and make people participate in the governance process? This panel, consisting of primarily e-Governance and citizen journalism practitioners, shall try to look into what has worked and what has not worked as far as e-Governance and citizen journalism working in isolation and in tandem is concerned."

I will then identify what this exactly means in terms of government's various roles, namely telecommunications infrastructures, software solutions and platforms, and e-government services. For each of these three roles, I will finally detail what exactly is expected from government from a liberal perspective. In conclusion, I will summarize the various roles of government in promoting e-government in terms of an overall e-policy."

This can be achieved through the adoption of new architectures such as cloud computing and service-oriented architecture, in the public sector. Cloud computing permits to uniformly cover the whole country with e-government solutions, independently of divergence of local administrative units that may be better or worse prepared to provide e-services. Service-oriented architecture facilitates provision of compound services covering whole customer processes, where a customer may be a citizen or an enterprise. Compound services provided jointly by administrative units and enterprises stimulate development of e-economy and create attractive job for well educated people."

In recent years, the need for more flexibility has become eminent due to the long implementation times of new legislations. As such, governments are searching for ways to create flexible business processes to adapt to changes. Yet there is little insight into how their business processes can be made more flexible. In this paper various ways of creating flexible business processes are reviewed. The quest for creating flexible processes is described by identifying various forms of the implementation of applications to execute business processes (workflows). We found that the implementations based on both knowledge rules (separating knowledge from processes) and event-condition-actions (ECA) mechanisms to determine the next step in a workflow, and resources (to deal with availability, utilization and ensure lead time) are expected to provide the highest level of flexibility to adapt to changes in the environment. Based on these findings, an ECA process orchestration architecture is developed and recommendations for further research are presented."

Making this information available to ordinary citizens is not trivial. Interoperability and citizen services are the two key words here. On one hand, interoperability refers to increasing level of cooperation between information sources on national, regional and local levels; and on the other hand, citizen services refers to providing a series of services that improve the relation between citizens and the public state, based on the stored geographic information. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel architectural solution based on an ontology-driven system (GeoMergeP), which describes the semantic integration of geographic sources as a basis of a web service structure. We illustrate the proposal with a motivating case study in the area of hydrological resources."

As a consequence several e-governance projects have been undertaken encompassing a wide range of governmental functions. While an attempt is being made to provide transparent, scalable, manageable and easily accessible services, this has led to some of the major concerns, like integration of such projects, interoperability among the services, and reusability of services. The Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) which has proven successful in building large, distributed heterogeneous systems has the potential to provide architectural support to develop e-governance solutions by integrating independent services developed and controlled by respective owners with their varied goals and parameters. In this paper we share our experience of using SOA in typical Government to Citizen (G2C) services provided through different e-Governance projects, like the Municipality Computerization project and the Common Service Centre (CSC) project. In the sequel we highlight the benefits and pitfalls in adopting SOA as an enabling technological framework for such e-Governance projects in India."

E-Government project management is identified as an area with an inherent need for reusing and exchanging information. Ontologies, by modelling concepts and their relationships, make possible descriptions of domains in a machine processable way. A feature like that is especially useful in the field of e-Government project management. Public administration officials, decision makers, implementers and politicians, show great interest in reusing and exchanging information concerning project management procedure, in an attempt to standardize the management operation, reuse of existing knowledge, improve collaboration and increase successful rates. The present paper presents an e-Government project management ontology comprised of the main concepts that should be managed during project implementation. It intends to encourage collaboration for the excellence and productivity of the management of e-Government project processes and enable the interoperability and reuse of knowledge between all factors and stakeholders related to the implementation of such types of projects."

CBR is an artificial intelligence technique which efficiently exploits the past experience to find solution of new problems. The CBR engine maintains a repository of past cases. On a new project approval request, the proposed inference system matches similar historical cases and suggests a solution for the new project. The proposed methodology has been evaluated on a case-base of sample projects."

This makes the requirement for robustness of e-Government portal relatively stringent. In view of this, it would be very useful to have an independent server that serves as a 24/7 watch-guard to monitor the performance of the service portal. In this paper, we proposed a Web-based performance monitoring system (WMS) for checking the health status of the service portal in real-time. Some basic server information is usually provided by the web hosting service provider. Usually these information are simple statistics such as the number of hits and server loads over a selected period of time. Further details regarding the performance of the portal however may not be available or they come at expensive prices. This service is provided either by some third-party proprietary commercial software tools on the market or through consultancy services. The proposed WMS provides additional performance checks with the advantage of open source and Java based implementation platform. It features web usage mining from web log files in addition to the statistics offered by the hosting company. A higher level of analytical insights can be obtained too when the two are combined. The functions of WMS include: Web Log Analysis, Web Usability Analysis, Website Performance Benchmarking, Web Link Validation, and Performance Reporting. WMS can be used as a generic monitoring tool for virtually all kinds of e-business models. Specifically, we discuss the context of applications of WMS to e-Government performance models."

After briefly introducing some of the challenges characterizing the building of an ""ICT-enabled Knowledge-Society"", and the implications of ICTs for development, the paper discusses potential and limits of e-Government vs. e-Governance. In defining the organizational and institutional dimension underpinning ICT-enabled Governance models, the paper positions e-Government activities within the broader framework of e-Governance (i.e., the governance with and of ICT), as a learning type of dynamics. e-governance involves at the same time a constrained and open relationship with local and global actors and the redefinition of the interaction between freedom and dependencies. Furthermore, the paper presents an overview of selected mega-trends in the area of ICTs and their policy implications for Governments, with a special focus on the case of the European Union. In doing so, the paper introduces some key policy issues around the governance ""with and of ICTs"", exploring future perspectives towards building an ICT-enabled Knowledge-Society. In this regard, it is important to outline a key question around which the paper is built: what kind of changes will take place in society in the next 10--20 years? And what will be the role of ICTs and emerging technologies in particular, in government operations? The paper concludes identifying clues of the potential benefits, as well as the risks and barriers connected to ICT-enabled governance, and the expected impacts on society in view of further research."

For that purpose the experiences of the use of Internet in participatory budgeting will be studied. Participatory Budget (PB) involves the direct participation of citizens in setting priorities in public investment. The following experiences of Digital Participatory Budget undertaken by municipalities in Brazil will be presented: Porto Alegre (RS) Ipatinga (MG), Belo Horizonte (MG) and Recife (PE). The methodology that was used includes literature search on the key concepts, discussion of the relationship between local governance and citizen participation, and presentation of experiences that produce findings on the impacts of the use of ICTs in participatory processes. Experiments are under a project carried out by Network Logolink called ""ELECTRONIC LOCAL GOVERNANCE: LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES"" and coordinated by the Office Pólis, São Paulo. Using the Internet, these participatory government budgets can increase citizen participation and allow thousands of people to decide on the allocation of public investment. Five Brazilian cases will be presented along with related challenges of local governance to identify their real capabilities of building a new relationship between government policy and society in Brazil and other countries. This research considers that the use of information and communication technologies, especially the Internet, can be a promoter of citizenship, including citizen participation. However this promotion may be limited by the condition of access to these technologies and the depth and quality of information available to the citizen that would undermine the exercise of citizens' rights."

When considering e-tax systems, things are slightly different: A generous array of ICT techniques and tools are available for the people. Web services, mobile information services, electronic IDs, member electronic cards, online bank account transfers and the like configure the so called ""holistic"" approach for tax collection in Latin America. These advanced tools make things that where hitherto impossible, now possible - better interaction with citizens, lower transaction costs, more transparent processes, egalitarian treatment, and an improved democracy in emerging economies. This imposes a huge challenge for public organizations and their officials, particularly when simple and low-cost tools are made available to organize tax collection issues, which was unthinkable before. This challenging duty was picked up in some countries. A new paradigm emerges from the Chilean and Argentinean experiences, both countries with a young democracy and high levels of professionalism in tax services. For instance, Chile has established a tuned up system of electronic tax return filing and tax payments. On the other hand, the Province of Buenos Aires in Argentina has developed web 2.0 services for corporate tax payers. This paper proposes a comparative exercise between both experiences in order to depict an e-tax system benchmark for other countries in the same need. The comparison includes tax return filling systems, information campaigns to increase awareness and usage of electronic tax products and services. The specific strategies in these two countries are depicted in order to replicate or transform them in other countries of similar situation, so as to assure higher rates of take-up of e-tax systems. Revenue organizations that are at an early stage in their development of electronic services may benefit from the examination of these approaches and experiences. There are many ""good practice"" conclusions that can be drawn from a South American e-tax benchmark as many countries lag behind their level of development."

However, rapid diffusion has also been constrained by limited access to stable electricity and broadband Internet technology. Beyond these factors which, in our view represent the ""supply side"" of e-governance, we review two case studies of successful electronic governance initiatives in Nigeria and suggest that ""demand side"" factors such as citizens' advocacy, participation in governance, preference for high quality public services as well as openness of government are also important in determining the rate at which e-government diffuses, and may also explain the differences in diffusion rates among countries."

To date, the world has moved into an era of advanced technological innovation that significantly affects all consumers of technology -- people, communities, governments and institutions. It is possible that benefits will begin to accrue from the 'digital age' in terms of social and economic development. However, in most developing countries, the majority of citizens, especially poor people in rural areas, are not benefiting from the rapid advancement of technology. Hence, there is a growing urgency of utilizing ICT-enabled services as tools, to equitably support sustainable social and economic development in poor communities. This paper premises that because different communities have different needs, ICTs ought to be provided in a manner that is responsive to local needs, in full recognition of the different multi-dimensional livelihoods of communities. This is critical for efficient and equitable distribution of ICT-enabled services, in order to contribute to social and economic development in the poorest communities. This paper focuses on the impact of digital community hubs (DCHs) in facilitating ICT diffusion and penetration in the Inanda Ntuzuma Kwamashu (INK) area. This is a presidential development node, located approximately 30 kilometers from Durban. The area is hugely composed of economically impoverished communities and has a significant political background. In the first section, the paper defines DCHs and their importance in enhancing ICT diffusion in impoverished peri-urban areas. In the second section, a brief discussion on strategic approaches to establishing sustainable DCHs is provided. Thirdly, the paper analyzes the utilization and accessibility of computers and other technologies by community members in the INK area, to communicate and access information and services, such as those related to education, health care, market prices, banking, business development services and government services. Fourthly, the paper identifies critical success factors necessary to facilitate ICT diffusion in peri-urban areas such as the INK community. Lastly, the role of government in supporting the implementation of DCHs is discussed and pertinent recommendations are provided."

Despite prolific advances in ICT, maturity in development of innovative ICT enabled tools for business processes, challenges of managing user expectations are still many. Dimensions of such challenges are quite diverse in the e-governance parlance as well. In most of the nations today, government systems are gradually and effectively embracing ICT in various forms to provide simple, moral, accountable, responsive and transparent (SMART) governance for their citizens. These governments are also facing challenges similar to the enterprises because of the same unique reason i.e. ""user interface"". Indian government systems are quite aggressively incorporating ICT enabled government processes to provide SMART governance in the country. National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) is formulated to provide the required support. NeGP recognizes ""citizen interface"" as an important link in the delivery system. Drawing experiences of ""user interface"" and its effect in successful implementations for enterprise wide ICT enabled processes and services; it is quite relevant that ""citizens"" are the most critical ""users"" in the e-governance systems. In Indian context, this carries enormous challenge to cater to the varied needs of rural citizens who are influenced by diverse socio-economic conditions and digital divides. Thus there is a need to study this important ""citizen interface"" issue. In this paper, it is argued that in addition to SMART governance systems, a demand driven ""citizen interface"" would enhance the success of e-governance services in India. Since a large section of India resides in rural areas, successful ""citizen interface"" is mostly contingent upon provisioning of demand driven services in these areas. Rural citizens in India reside in villages and their aggregated needs do not reflect adequately at the state and/or national level. However, various common services including e-governance services are rendered at the village level based on the policies framed at state/national level. Therefore, it is important that gross national estimates of demand on e-governance systems should also take cognizance of individual household needs. In this paper, a framework is presented to understand the citizen interface issues, identify the factors responsible for demand assessment and influencing access to e-governance services. This framework also aims to discuss contributors to a successful e-governance set up in the village on a sustainable basis. Two cases are discussed to examine the underpinnings of the framework."

The consequences of the usage on the benefits, as well as the relationships between the determinants and the usage warrant more exploration. A better understanding of the success realization will not only reduce the e-government research gap, but will definitely assist the federal government in evaluating the G2B system effectiveness. In addition, evidences of the critical aspects of the determinants will enable public organizations as system owners to react accordingly to any information system usage and sustainability in the future."

The main concepts of ANT such as Actor-Network, Black Boxes, moments of Translation: Problematisation, Interessement, Enrolment and Mobilization are examined to see how much ANT can help in understanding the socio-technical nature of e-Government and information systems in general. Also ANT was used as a tool to understand how change took place in situations where some beliefs such as exercising power by those who think they own the power can exercise it to enforce the adoption of new technology and create a critical mass. Furthermore, this illustrates how after interweaving a relationship between ANT concepts and e-Government the findings might be used to enhance the design of e-government implementation plans."

On this account the paper will interact with supply and demand side practices of e-governance specifically in Kenya, although drawing from global circumference. From the supply side, we look at Kenya's current e-governance practice, whether it is indeed achieving development objectives. From the demand side the paper seeks to understand the extent in which citizens are interacting with government's web presence, and the issues that underlie this extent. On both these accounts, we consider the level of developmentalism brought about by computer based web presence and access to government services and information through mobile phones. We will also attempt to dismantle the bottlenecks that impede access to government services and information even in a connected environment. Then emerging from this line of interrogation we move on to reflect on alternatives, in particular the greater possibilities which lie in mobile phones relative to computer based Internet."

This paper analyzes the link between individual verifiability on the one hand and anonymity, receipt-freeness and coercion-resistance on the other hand. We approach the issue by analyzing remote as well as paper-based cryptographic voting schemes which make use of public bulletin boards. We investigate to which extent the considered protocols meet the above requirements, especially in the long term when computational assumptions may no longer hold. We also give ideas on how to improve the protocols in this respect. The paper aims at providing an overview in order to support election hosts such as companies, associations and government agencies in selecting appropriate e-voting schemes with respect to the priority of either freedom and secrecy of the vote or voter-verifiability."

A typology for participation limits in public decision processes and their relation with the communicative potential of Internet in mobilization is proposed. The role of government agencies in the context of a transformed public sphere is dealt with by focusing on their mobilization strategies, functions and processes, considering that information and especially, attention management constitute a critical factor in shaping a public space in which the elements of an inclusive democracy may be recovered. This inclusive nature may be characterized by valuing publicity as a condition for political interaction which provides for open acknowledgment of political positions and the consideration of diversity and dissent as constituent elements of the political process. An open reflection is proposed as a conclusion, questioning the role for government agencies and the possibilities for e-democracy on the promotion of a radical democratic perspective for improved political participation in conditions of unequal access to political spaces."

The character of extra-power authority places the Ombudsman in a favoured situation opposite to a tutelary and peacemaker function. Moreover, with a suitable technical (legal) framework, it would be possible to transform towards an electronic administration for providing better service to citizens. This work explores the development of the 'Electronic Ombudsman', an institution with a certain degree of specialization, useful in linking the Administration, citizens and technologies. It presents a theoretical analysis of circumstances that appear as opportunities and risks in advancing towards the Information Society. In a complex society, the Electronic Ombudsman's objective becomes clear as soon as we visualize and focus on its protection objective - the citizen and their rights."

However, many eGovernment initiatives are unsuccessful leading to huge loss of money within the Public Sector and also to loss of trust on new technologies from the side of stakeholders. The online public service delivery brings with it a whole nexus of problems that cannot be solved by technological means alone. The technical perspective can fails to bear fruit. In developing and maintaining online public services and in order to encourage a climate of cooperation it is vital to redefine existing working practices considering the socio-organizational relationships in which they take place. In this paper, we propose a model of abstract and functional dimensions that affect the success of eGovernment initiatives. On the basis of our model, necessary short life cycle solutions must evolve towards a final solution that allows a reliable and flexible accomplishment of modernization projects. In this context, our contribution could be used as a metaphor to represent the necessary management of eGovernment initiatives."
2009,A study on government-dominated e-government outsourcing model,"Gao, Jianhua; Yang, Wensheng; Fang, Guixi",China; China; China,e-government outsourcing; government-dominated; quality inspection and quarantine,Proceedings of the 3rd international conference on Theory and practice of electronic governance,10.1145/1693042.1693089,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?preflayout=flat&doid=1693042.1693089,E-Government;Outsourcing;Human resources;Information security;Finance;Ownership;Government,0,200,"Based on interviews and field research, this paper presents a comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of various outsourcing models generally adopted by Chinese government agencies in their e-government initiatives, with special focus laid on the elaboration of the government-dominated e-government outsourcing model. With a view to solving the problem of staff shortage, ensuring governmental information security, and promoting sustainable development of e-government, China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) has organized a limited liability company--Beijing iTowNet Cyber Technology Ltd, to provide outsourcing services concerning e-government system development, operation and maintenance for the administration. With such measures as rational ownership structure, adequate management, and introduction of standards, AQSIQ has not only successfully addressed difficulties caused by lack of human, technical, and financial resources, but ensured its dominance, supervision and control over e-government outsourcing. This paper not only advocates a specific government-dominated approach for other Chinese government agencies to learn from in their e-government initiatives, but provides an innovative theoretical perspective and serves as a typical case for study for government agencies of many other developing countries."

The aim of this project was to help Latin-American municipalities to use ICT tools to improve efficiency and transparency in its activities. The project was developed between 2005 and 2006 in 22 municipalities distributed in 11 countries, with the support of 5 experts of 5 different nationalities. The first phase followed a diagnostic of the general situation of the municipality, including technological aspects, and also transparency perceptions. Then a proposal of strategy to apply electronic government was developed with the collaboration of a Consultancy Team and the Task Force defined by the Major in each municipality. Furthermore, all the participants in the project received a virtual course about fundamentals in electronic government strategies. With the document approved by the society and the political ambit the Consultancy Team accompanied the Task Force in the implementation process, using in some cases the technological support of the project, specifically with software applications to develop the Web page of the municipality -- MuniPortal, another software -- MuniCompra; to improve the buying process and a last one to support the creation of a one stop window for the municipality services -- MuniServi. Additionally, this paper also presents evidence of the implementation process and the general data about the diagnostics developed."

Driven by demands for a more responsive government, India has been grappling with how to a one stop government solution using the best technologies to deliver services to the people. Government's use of technology, particularly Web-based Internet applications, to enhance citizen access to government services and to enable citizens to use online services is not only migrating traditionally paper-based and face-to-face services to the Internet, but also has the potential to provide citizens with the fastest and most convenient way of using government services. E-Governance has given new dimensions to the system of governing nations and enhancing citizen services by making the process of governance and public administration much more efficient and effective. E-Government reveals the ultimate vision for public administrations and governments to undergo a huge modernisation and reorganisation. E-Governance has also played an essential role in improving governmental processes (e-administration), connecting citizens (e-citizens and e-services) and building external interactions (e-society). With the inclusion if e-governance in governing process came the concept of Single Entry National Portal i.e. One Stop Government which efficiently integrates public services from a citizen's point of view. Such Portals help the citizens and other stakeholders to have a 24x7x365 access to public service authorities and the services being provided by them at a single point. Various Government Departments at Central, State and Local level collect, use and manage large volumes of information and services. To ensure effective access to government policymaking and operations as well as to ensure government accountability, the public needs consistent, predictable access to government information. One Stop Government Portals provide full entry to its citizens making their lives easy and smooth. This paper discourses the significance of One Stop Government accentuating india.gov.in - the National Portal of India; a comprehensive repository of information regarding the citizen services available in India."

The case study provides details on the methodology used, lessons learnt, key success factors, challenges faced, and recommendations for future usage of crowdsourcing for building e-Governance applications. In this initiative, named INVITE, students were engaged in e-Governance application design and development for real project scenarios of various government departments. In a span of 2 years over 5000 students pursuing undergraduate and graduate courses from nearly 100 colleges and universities across the state participated. Over 500 faculty members also participated as project guides for the students who worked in teams of 3 or 4 members. Use of open source software tools was made mandatory. This community e-Governance initiative was supported by the three main pillars of the IT ecosystem - Government, Industry and Academia. A nodal IT agency of the state government documented 27 real world e-Governance project scenarios for various departments for the INVITE crowdsourcing experiment. Village kiosks for farmers, land records, animal husbandry, and museum administration are some of the areas for which the students developed applications. A programming contest was announced for attracting students to participate in the initiative. The state department of technical education provided impetus to INVITE by sending official circulars to heads of universities and colleges to encourage the students to take up the projects as part of their course requirements. An industry sponsor funded the basic infrastructure of a website for team registration and project submission, program management agency for mass communications, posters, and prizes for best applications for each project scenario. Provision was made to reward the faculty guides of winning teams and their institutes as well. As the student teams competed, the state government benefited by getting very good e-Governance applications developed for free by the crowdsourcing model. Various government departments nominated ""resource persons"" who interacted with the project teams to answer their queries about the prevailing manual systems and their vision of e-Governance for those functions. In summary, INVITE became a great platform for crowdsourcing resulting in ""e-Governance for the people, by the people""."

Developing countries like Mongolia recognize the need to harness ICT applications for e-government and public service delivery. Policy and regulatory environment is one of the most critical factors affecting the development of ICT infrastructure, e-applications and services. Particularly in rural areas, which are perceived as unattractive to private carriers, more economic incentives need to be built in the related policy and regulation environment to encourage investment in rural ICT development and to ensure universal service provision. Emphasis is needed from policy makers and regulators with the cooperation from all other stakeholders in promoting rural broadband development. Technological options are available for new installations as well as for upgrading existing networks. The objective of this paper is to introduce and share the ICT development and e-government policy, and its measures and special programs for rural and remote areas, achievement and key challenges in Mongolia compared with global trends. The paper attempts to cover key challenges Mongolia is now facing for example legal frameworks, policy and regulatory issues, universal service obligation fund, public and private sector partnership, and foreign assistance initiatives."

However, within the African continent, it is steadily emerging as a strong force on the platform of electronic governance. This relevance is being achieved through a well articulated National Information Technology [IT] Policy and collaboration between the national IT agencies [the National IT Development Agency and its subsidiary, the National e-Government Strategies] and government ministries, departments and agencies [MDA's]. One of such MDA's is the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria [TRCN] which has the statutory duty of regulating the teaching profession in both the public and private sectors of Nigeria and at all levels of the education system [from the primary to the university levels]. The TRCN's scope of responsibilities as the regulator of the largest occupational group in Nigeria placed it on the list of priority agencies to transit to electronic governance with the help of the nation's IT agencies. This paper therefore reviews the innovations, successes and challenges recorded in the transformation of the teaching profession in Nigeria to electronic governance."

We carried out a study on Internet usage of patients who were attending specialist clinics, in a government tertiary care hospital, and a private hospital in Galle. The two hospitals are Teaching Hospital Karapitiya, which is the main government hospital in Southern province of Sri Lanka, and Southern Hospital, which is a private hospital in Galle, Sri Lanka. Every other patient was interviewed using an investigator-administered questionnaire while they were waiting for consultation. Three hundred and fifty five patients (or guardians in the Paediatric clinic) participated in the study. Results from the study show that one hundred and seventy two (48.3%) participants have heard about the Internet. There was a relationship between awareness of the Internet and age, educational level and the clinic attended. There was no difference in awareness when gender or the hospital attended was considered. Only three participants (0.97%) have used the Internet to find information about their disease conditions. Close relatives of two participants have assisted them in searching the Internet for information about their conditions. Altogether, the Internet was used to obtain information on the disease condition of five participants (1.4%). Very low usage of the Internet for health information retrieval revealed in this study is probably due to low awareness of the Internet and low educational level of citizens. Improvement of IT and the related infrastructure in Sri Lanka could help in improving the health of individuals using this technology as a health education tool."

As it is well established that websites facilitate an efficient and timely interaction between the citizens and the Government, the availability of web driven information and services also finds its space as one of the 27 Mission Mode Projects of the NeGP. With the penetration of the Internet and its availability on a range of devices, it is highly likely that the first point of interface for enabling information and services from Government departments to the citizens' will be the Government Websites. The ""Indian Right to Information Act - 2005"" has further strengthened the initiative by requiring mandatory disclosures of certain categories of information by the government to citizens and other stakeholders. However such a system still does not validate the best practices of information delivery through websites. On critically evaluating a number of websites available in the Indian government web space, there still remain certain challenges like lack of identity and citizen centricity, inconsistency in presentation and navigation strategy, outdated content, non compliance to best practices and above all insufficient sensitivity to the access needs of people with special needs, which require attention. These are major impediments in allowing citizens to effectively use the government websites. This paper outlines a mechanism to address the above challenges so as to provide much better experience to citizens while accessing government websites and also enhance the level of trust in government while accessing information and availing government services online."

As a result, many least developed countries have developed national tourism Web portals in order to endorse tourism sector on the Internet. Search engines have become the most preferred way of seeking information on the Internet. Therefore, national tourism portal's visibility on search engines is crucial for Nepal because tourism is the major source of foreign income earnings. The objective of this study is to evaluate search engine visibility of Nepal Government's national tourism Web portal. The study is mainly divided into three parts. The first part of the study starts with identification of keywords that were previously used by tourists to search information related to Nepal prior to their travel. The frequently occurring keywords were then used to conduct the search engine ranking analysis of the portal. The second part of the study examined the portal's home page against popular search engine optimization guidelines that are prescribed to improve Website's search engine visibility. The third part of the study investigated Nepal government's effectiveness towards utilizing the World Wide Web to market the portal. The findings showed that the portal had low search engine visibility, minimally conformed to search engine optimization guidelines, and the Web was not effectively used to market the portal."

Information technology covers a wide range of services rendered by the public administration, communities, and non-governmental and social organizations to the public. Information Communication Technology (ICT) initiatives for rural development in Nepal began in 1994 and are being used mainly to increase effectiveness in service delivery. The Tenth Development Plan of Nepal (2002--2007), had put emphasis on Information Technology. The plan had envisaged to establish a total of 300 rural information centers mainly in the rural districts of Nepal. The Interim Three Year Plan of Nepal (2007/8--2009/10) has also placed due consideration in the development of information technology. But as against the Tenth Plan target, only a total of 113 numbers of rural Tele-centers were established in remote districts of the country by different entities. It is interesting to note that of the total, 63 Tele-centers were established by private and Non-Governmental Organizations. There is little research done to keep track of transformation and adaptation of Community e-Centers (CeCs) to serve the developmental needs of the community. UN/ESCAP had published a document relating to this Tele-center in 2005. Therefore, a case study was carried out specifically to examine the management and sustainability part of Panauti Tele-center, established in June 2004 at Kavre district (1400 m). The paper examines the current status of Panauti Tele-centre in terms of its users, uses, and sustainability."

These activities are usually characterized by bulk volumes with complex variables, bureaucratic workflows and the need to function in a regulated environment under which many partners participate. In the past, e-Government procurement involved a lot of manual processes which are known to be time-consuming and may be error-prone. In this paper, we present the design of a Web-based Tendering System which aims at improving the efficiency as well as transparency of the tendering process. In addition to a prototype which we developed as a proof-of-concept, we modelled the new system using a Business Process Reengineering tool. We showed that certain processes could be automated by leveraging the power of Internet and information technology and that operating costs could be lowered in the new model. Various tendering schemes can be supported. In particular, our new design incorporates a decision-support design at the backend for assisting a panel of judges pertaining to suggestions on how the jobs could be allocated to different bidders. As a core of the decision-support module, the system has an automated analyzer that rationally considers the bidders' backgrounds and feasibilities, in the perspective of achieving an overall goal."

In order to improve the country's slow pace of development, an e-Governance Master Plan (eGMP) was adopted in 2006. One of the main aims of the project was to improve the social and economic conditions of rural communities, in 38 districts of Nepal, by 20% within the next three years. This was to be accomplished through the Information and Communication Development Program, or ICTD. To guarantee that these aims are met, we primarily need to ensure that all the Nepalese get their National Identification certificates in a phase-wise manner, that we have basic information about them, and that online services are accessible to them. Therefore, a key sub-project has been initiated under ICTD - the National Identification System (NID), which covers all these objectives. The NID project, once completed, will provide multiple services through a single portal, quick retrieval of information of the citizen and will facilitate public services such as health, education, welfare benefits, passport control, tax, voting, criminal records, utility bills, land records, government services with a unique NID. The Ministry of Home affairs is responsible for implementing the project, and it will be supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), who will provide 80% of the total funds needed for the project, under the guidelines of eGMP. Even though the NID project is poised to deliver promising results, there are several hurdles related directly to its implementation. These challenges include political instability, lack of proper management of the project, lack of co-ordination between stakeholders and the lack of adequate skilled manpower. As a member of Project Implementation Unit (PIU) of National Identification System (NID), the author presents in this paper the NID project from his experience, along with the key issues hindering the progress of this project."

This has led to increased level of public concern over receipt of large number of UCC. To give relief to affected telecom subscribers, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has brought in ""Telecom Unsolicited Commercial Communications Regulations 2007"" in June 2007 and subsequent amendments in March 2008 and October 2008 to restrict such UCCs. To implement the said regulation, TRAI has decided to use ICT tools to setup National Do Not Call (NDNC) Registry Portal and engaged National Informatics Centre (NIC), Government of India, for IT enablement of NDNC Registry. NDNC Registry Portal has been set up in G2C (affected telecom subscribers), G2B (Telecom Operators (TOs) and Telemarketers (TMs)) and G2G (TRAI, Department of Telecommunications (DoT)) domains and is implemented to curb the UCCs and give relief to the society at large who are making use of telecom resources. The NDNC Registry has consolidated databases of subscribers of all TOs operating in India who do not wish to receive UCC, TMs who want to scrub their calling lists and the telecom resources being used by such TMs."

Indian RTI Act 2005 envisage for a citizen to seek for information from any of the government department/organization(s)/NGOs termed as Public Authorities (PA), virtually on any issue by filing an RTI request to the concerned Public Information Officer (PIO). In case the information seeker does not get the information sought for within stipulated time frame of a month or is not satisfied with the information provided by the PIO can prefer an appeal before 1st Appellate Authority (AA) of the concerned department/organization and subsequently before the 2nd Appellate Authority i.e. Central Information Commission (CIC). Alternatively one can also file a complaint with the CIC in case RTI regime has not been put in place by the Department/Organization. In order to facilitate those citizens who files appeal and complaints before the Commission; two simple user friendly online forms (The Citizen Module, http://rti.india.gov.in) have been designed in congruence with the RTI Act. Whereas on the other hand an internal workflow system has also been designed, developed and implemented within CIC (The Administrative Workflow Module), which ensures proper monitoring of the entire activities during disposal of a case since its filing."

E-governance is moving one step further to establish the integral framework for transparent, accountable and trust-based decision-making processes for such service delivery. Although intrinsically related to each other, practice shows that successful e-government and e-governance are not synonymous, but complementary. Based on the first-hand data and findings of the United Nations E-government Survey of 2010, this paper demonstrates that three strategy clusters can bridge e-government and e-governance: Static Supply-based (SS); Dynamic Demand-driven (DD); and Interactive Integration (II) Strategies. It also maintains that although high-income countries fare better in building robust e-government systems, less well-off countries can make considerable strides in moving towards successful e-governance. Finally, the paper argues that strong and healthy e-government can hardly be sustained unless e-governance is strengthened."

Enterprises and citizens expect public administrations to be agile and pro-active to foster development. A way to achieve agility and pro-activity is application of a model of Collaborative Network Organizations in its two forms: Virtual Organizations (VO) and Virtual Organization Breeding Environments (VOBE). In the paper, advantages are shown of public administration playing a role of a Virtual Organization customer on the one hand, and a Virtual Organization member on the other hand. It is also shown how public administration playing a role of a Virtual Organization Breeding Environment may improve its agility and promote advanced technologies and management methods among local organizations. It is argued in the paper that public administration should provide a Virtual Organization Breeding Environment as a part of public services."

Such transformation is very challenging and requires effective management and leadership skills that would facilitate organizational, social, economic, and political innovations. This paper discusses a change in benchmarking which occurs in response to the new challenges of e-government implementation. It highlights the results of the 2010 World e-Government ranking conducted by Waseda University and analyses the emergent trends of e-government development in the world such as government 2.0 and innovative leadership. Evolving competencies for success as a GCIO are shown using a case of e-government implementation in Japan and major surveyed countries."

Governments have initiated multi-faceted programs and efforts to provide enhanced services through means and methods that are being facilitated by the Internet. Forms and norms of services have been shaped by the maturity of ICTs in respective countries and communities. This paper explores various scenarios of electronic forms of government, and argues that it is a prerequisite to reach the common mass of people. Particularly, the paper reviews the use of ICTs in eight countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). It investigates some basic parameters of ICT usage by retrieving archived data from various institutions and organizations."

The methodology used was the literature research on key concepts, followed by the discussion of the relationship between local governance and citizen participation and the presentation of experiences that produced findings on the impacts of the use of ICTs in participatory processes. Four Brazilian cases (Porto Alegre, Ipatinga, Belo Horizonte and Recife), one Peruvian (Miraflores) and one from Argentina (BellaVista) are presented and related challenges to local governance in identifying their real capabilities of building a new relationship between government policy and society in Latin American regions is discussed. Through the use of the Internet, these participatory government budgets can increase citizen participation and allow thousands of people deciding the allocation of public investment. This research considers that the use of ICTs, especially the Internet, can be a promoter of citizenship and citizen participation. However, this promotion may be limited by the condition of access to these technologies and the depth and quality of information available to citizens that would undermine the enjoyment of the rights of citizens."

With rapid development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and increasing awareness of the benefits of Electronic Governance, ICT-enabled transformation of governance processes become part of national development strategies in the developing world. Particularly, Electronic Governance programs are increasingly aligned with core development objectives strategically utilized to tackle major development challenges like the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In this paper; we address the development of e-government in Afghanistan. We start by present some facts about Afghanistan. Next, we discuss what role e-government can play in national development and finally present the status of e-Government development in the country."

E-Government reduces costs, increases transparency and citizen participation in decision-making processes, strengthens accountability, improves service delivery, etc. In the process of setting up e-Government initiatives and to become successful, there are some prime issues for developing countries to assess and to research. In developing nations where capital is a major scarcity, failing to be successful in the implementation of information communication technology (ICT) initiatives can have a great impact. In case of faller, the leadership commitment, which is already low in some countries, could be greatly affected. This will cause major obstacles to get some other ICT project's approved. ICT is a capital intensive (for example in infrastructure and application development) and requires qualified human resources. Apart from this, the globalization and dynamism associated with the field are making the realization of e-Government in particular in developing countries more challenging. Implementing e-Government principles and functions require a range of standards, guidelines, rules, policies and legislative changes which do not exist in most developing countries. These all add up to the challenges in e-Government implementation. The following are also potential threats in implementing e-Government: low level working culture, high resistance, weak private sector, low level collaboration/partnership between private and public sectors, etc. In this case study, I will assess the potential of e-Government projects and initiatives for developing countries by taking the case of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The opportunities will be widely discussed by taking practical examples. I will also identify and analyze major challenges that may be encountered in implementing e-Government initiatives based on my practical experience in Ethiopia."

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are instrumental here. Though, the implementation of ICTs in Local Government Agencies (LGA) is a challenge too. That's why effective new services delivery models and successful adoption of enabling ICTs within the LGA goes hand-in-hand. Following these considerations, this paper aims at illustrating a case of ICT-based solutions adoption into a Local Government Agency in charge of tourism promotion. More specifically the e-business case methodology crafted and used for this purpose will be shown. In doing so, the role of the e-business case will be advocated both as a tool to accompany Local Government Agencies into the process of introducing and using ICTs, both as a starting point for a wider strategy aimed at modernizing local communities though ICTs."

This relationship could become closer and more frequent with the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). However, very few studies have focused on understanding the use of ICTs in the local governments of developing countries. The purpose of this study is to provide evidence about the status of Mexican local governments in terms of their use of ICTs. It is based on an exploratory online survey administered to 108 local governments and 59 interviews with local government chief information officers (CIOs). The study concludes that there are important limitations related to infrastructure, use of software, and the development of their websites. This paper presents the main findings of this exploratory research and provides some practical recommendations."

Efficient ways of sharing and managing knowledge is imperative for the effectiveness of e-government initiatives in any country. Thus, e-government and knowledge management initiatives should not be managed separately. This paper, based on an interpretative research approach discusses the theoretical and practical aspects of knowledge management and e-government initiatives in the context of developing countries. For the purpose of analysis, online research papers and reports were investigated and Bangladesh was considered as representative of a typical developing country. The case for Bangladesh shows that while the government can easily present online a number of its services, these may not be effective for the targeted users as those services have failed to address some critical implementation factors. Furthermore, the paper discusses critical factors for e-government initiatives that are important for policy makers to enable them efficiently participate in the knowledge sharing process using the appropriate methods and technologies."

This paper is based on finding from a comprehensive literature review, which focused on research reports measuring progress by UK Government in delivering public services online. The state of Maldivian Government's web services was measured using a website assessment survey and user experiments. Compared to the UK, the Maldivian Government was discovered to be far behind in its online presence, with only two thirds of the central government agencies online, providing between 31 to 40 percent of the features present in UK government websites. In addition, users found it difficult to navigate and find information on the Maldivian government websites. Based on these findings, a number of recommendations are made for the development of Maldives Government on the Web."

It is the gap between ""have"" and ""have not"" in terms of information use and access. There have been many efforts carried out by different sectors in filling this gap. E-government is considered as a tool to reduce this gap along with enhancing the economic, political, societal condition of a nation. Few countries have achieved maximum benefits in reducing the gap through e-government and many countries are still struggling on it. There are still big differences between these countries. Based upon the achievements and other defined parameters, UN does the survey in every two years and makes a report. As per the report, some countries are successful enough to increase its position in UN index and some countries are not successful. We try to identify the reason behind these in this paper. We consider two countries, highly developed and least developed We take Korean case as developed country and Nepalese case as least developed country and do comparative study in this paper. Finding the force that makes Korea to move up and Nepal to move down is the main theme of this paper. At the end of the paper we provide the recommendations for Korea to maintain its position and also for Nepal to move up from existing position."

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) emerged as an alternative to Proprietary Software and has since its introduction made inroads onto desktops and servers alike. With FOSS emerged the freedom to run the programs for any purpose, freedom to study and modify the software, freedom to copy the software and share with neighbors and freedom to improve the program and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits. This paper makes a case for these freedoms. The paper first compares PS and FOSS use in Ghana and proposes a way for government to adopt FOSS. Findings of this case study are a result of field research conducted by the authors, personal interviews and through desk research."

Using the case of Indian rail transport, the authors have examined the extent to which IOG governance framework can help in developing interventions to achieve governance outcomes. The paper has presented case studies on various functional areas of Indian Railways and discussed relevant e-Government applications. The discussion has highlighted the existing e-Government applications, or lack thereof, that have been associated with the principles of legitimacy and voice, strategic vision, performance, accountability and fairness by various scholars. The analysis suggests that it is practical and feasible to use a good governance framework as a method of developing an e-Governance strategy that can enable the stakeholders monitor and evaluate governance outcomes. The authors have highlighted the need for further research to examine the shortcomings and opportunities of using this method in strategy development, program management and evaluation using real projects."

Consequently, the number of Transnational Knowledge Networks (TKNs) that aim to address critical global issues and problems continue to increase. As exchanging knowledge and information represent core components of these networks, this paper provides the foundations to study knowledge and information sharing in these emerging organizations. The paper starts by describing the structures, goals, and objectives of TKNs and presents a simplified conceptual model to demonstrate the main characteristics of these networks. Then, we review the pertinent e-government literature and argue the need to include findings from two additional research areas, cross-boundary information sharing and knowledge transfer. The paper discusses the ways in which contributions from these areas can enhance our understanding of the complexity surrounding the exchange process in these networks. The paper concludes with a summary of the elements of complexity and an overview of future research to empirically test these concepts."

The adopted framework of boundaries is proved to be a useful analytical tool to perceive various vertical and horizontal boundaries in the initiatives of cross-boundary information sharing and integration in different e-Government contexts. A new process boundary in the vertical dimension is also identified. In addition, centralized information systems in the case study can help to decrease boundaries. Lastly, it is also perceived that vertical boundaries are not always easier to cross than horizontal boundaries."

The US Government originally developed NIEM to support cross-jurisdictional information sharing between state and local governments and federal agencies. We review how the US Government employed NIEM to facilitate reporting and improve transparency of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) and propose lessons and next steps to encourage broader information sharing in general and the use of NIEM in particular. We call for the development of common standards that implementing partners and donor organizations can use -- and reuse -- in multiple countries and for multiple projects. Establishing standards is the first step to building systems that share information and enable countries to improve governance and collaborate across boundaries. Finally, we propose specific actions that the donor community can adopt to promote the emergence of these standards."

Basic approaches to service development are published, but there is a lack of sharing ""best practices"" how to implement this step by step in the area of e-government. In particular, it is unknown to what extent administrations are able to follow existing service development approaches and reach a successful outcome within a reasonable frame of time and resources, or what are the barriers to applying the state-of-the-art methodologies? The research approach is exploratory. The case of Egypt, where service-oriented architecture was chosen as the main interoperability approach, is investigated how services are currently being developed and what kind of methodological enhancements could be appropriate. The case analysis on practical and strategic level leads to proposing success factors of developing G2G services with respect to problem perception, action plan, commitment, and future options. These can be used as hypothesis in future research and also as guidelines for improving governance, staff development and change management in administrative practice."

Such services have been implemented on heterogeneous platforms and under different administrative control. The main objective of SORIG has been to facilitate ""one-stop"" access to various services of the Government. In this paper, we share our experience of integrating the newly developed web based Geographical Information System Services to the SORIG framework. This integration has helped in extending the scope of the information access capability of both the rural mass as well as the administration during disasters, general and local elections as well as monitoring of different rural programmes of the government."

Beijing acted in a different way. The Municipal Office of Information in Beijing is responsible for managing its e-government programme. The office has been advancing the e-government programme through technology innovations in the past 10 years. With this approach, the Municipal Office of Information did not have the need to change government systems and mechanisms rapidly. It only had to focus on the construction and management of technical infrastructures of the city's e-government programme from the beginning. These e-government technical infrastructures support with the government departments' business processes. When most government departments cannot work without these technical infrastructures, Municipal Office of Information through its authority built an e-government workflow system gradually."

Flexibility is the general ability to react to changes, whilst agility is the speed in responding to variety and changes Both flexibility and agility are diverse concepts that are hard to grasp. In this paper the types of flexibility and agility of business processes is discussed on a foundation level and an approach to measure the level of flexibility and agility is proposed. A case study of the flexibility and agility measurement is used to demonstrate the approach. The illustration is used to discuss the difficulties and limitations of the measurement approach. There is no uniform definition of or view on flexibility and agility. This makes it hard to develop a measurement approach. Furthermore, as business processes can be different, this might result in different metrics for measuring the level of flexibility and agility. There is no single measure and for each type of business process and flexibility and agility should always measure by a combination of metrics. In addition, both qualitative and quantitative metrics should be used to measure the level of flexibility and agility."

In this way, it also contributes to the identification and dissemination of best practices of e-procurement systems in the region. Finally, it establishes clear reference points so that countries can orient themselves with regard to what they must accomplish to achieve a higher level of maturity of their technological capacity. The model measures two main areas, (1) legal and institutional arrangements and (2) the technical functioning of the system. These areas are separated into a number of variables that permit a mapping of the system that shows the advances achieved in each of these areas. There is a scoring system with relative weights assigned to each variable that produces a quantitative indicator about the state of progress of the system. The main objective was to design a useful tool for periodically measuring the status of government e-procurement systems in the region and to identify experiences/practices that could be shared among the Inter-American Network on Government Procurement. In developing the design, existing indicators, including those from the Multilateral Development Banks and the OECD Methodology for Assessment of National Procurement Systems, and other relevant diagnostic tools were reviewed to determine if there were any additional indicators that should be included and/or substituted. Also many contributions and feedback were gathered from the network region. The feedback played an important role in promoting ownership of the tool, as well as enabling it to benefit from the experience and knowledge of the participants. Finally, the framework was applied to 14 countries in Latin American and the Caribbean Region, several changes and adjustments to be made, providing a better fit for the model. The rank generated fit well with the previous perception and was well received by the participant countries."

There is a clear movement from an almost exclusive focus on the efficiency impacts of e-Government for government itself to more attention being paid to effectiveness impacts, as well as to wider governance impacts. This is going hand-in-hand with a change away from measuring only the inputs and outputs of e-Government initiatives towards much greater emphasis on analyzing and measuring the outcomes for constituents and the impacts for society as a whole, for example through increased public value. In addition, the article considers likely future e-Government measurement trends which involve moving both policy target setting and measurement from central government to local government, from the back-office to the front-office, and to frontline professional staff, whether care or medical professionals, police, community workers, teachers, etc. Taking this further, it also seems likely that in future constituents themselves will also be involved in policy target setting and measurement when directly related to their own use of public sector services and facilities."

Despite the amount of literature and experience available, the complexity of establishing a governance framework continues to present a challenge to public sector officials. Systematic examinations of these efforts are providing new insights to assist officials in anticipating challenges and creating context-specific frameworks that enhance the public value of IT. This paper presents case studies of two U.S. states with centralized and federated IT governance structures. Drawing on a research project at the Center for Technology in Government that included an environmental scan and interviews with state-level IT leaders, we describe how these two states approached the creation of IT governance frameworks from different contextual perspectives. The cases highlight how despite similarities in terms of political support for IT governance, cultural and organizational factors in each state led to the adoption of quite different, yet seemingly appropriate, IT governance frameworks. Despite significant differences across the two states, we are able to capture design advice that spans across both centralized and federated IT governance frameworks."

Against this background, the question can be posed of how the governance of IT must be organised in the future and to what extent the current steering methods and instruments can be used to achieve this. In recent years, studies have been made to determine how the management of IT must be organised. However, these studies focused on past experience and took insufficient account of the changes that will occur in the future as a result of the rise of the network society. This paper consists of the second analysis of the suitability of an instrument for the governance of IT in the network society. In the first analysis the Raines rules were reviewed; in this article the Gateway review method is assessed. First, a normative framework is presented to examine the extent to which it is possible to use the current steering instruments for the governance of IT in the future. This framework is based on two developments that should be taken into account and, based on these developments, a set of constraints and principles are described with which steering methods and instruments must comply. This framework is then used to examine the extent to which the Gateway review method is suited to managing IT in the future. When this method is plotted against the constraints described in the normative framework, it becomes clear that the scope in which the method has been applied so far is different from the scope in which the instrument should be used in the future. Based on the principles described in the normative framework, some observations are made regarding how the method could be used in another way. Finally, based on this analysis, a number of conclusions and recommendations are formulated for the development of steering methods and instruments in the network society."

As ICT penetrated in society, scholars refocused their discussions on the demand side. They analyzed how citizens use the tools of e-governance. Most research has shown that the potential use of government websites didn't match the actual use. Number of reasons has been suggested for citizens' non-use of this technology around the world. This paper analyses limits and challenges of online interaction between municipalities and citizens, who, by contrast, wish to use municipal websites, and communicate with municipal officials. Empirical data collected in Istanbul by interviews with activists and ordinary citizens show that citizens who have access to ICT wish to e-interact with municipalities but there are limitations that mostly stem from the municipalities' side. Following the discussion over the data, this paper concludes with strategy recommendations for municipalities to increase the use of municipal website, and to improve e-communication and e-participation."

For each paper we paid close attention to author's institutional association and department, publish journal names and issues, paper length, research themes, research methods, levels of analysis, and geographical focus in order to take a multi-faceted view. Findings from the study suggested that in terms of research methods, most papers take a descriptive approach such as experiences illustration, practice introduction and viewpoints, and only a few papers meet the typical rigorous standard for academic papers. Also, we found that most OPS studies in China focus on service construction while only a few touch service quality assessment. This study indicates that China's OPS practice was still at its early developmental stage. Although practitioners and researchers both agreed on the significance of OPS for China's administrative reform, it is clear that practices are still lagging behind."

This study extracts the development activities from public websites and e-services for citizens and businesses. The study is based on the literature review and major website investigation to explore e-services provided government organizations in Bangladesh. Though lack of proper infrastructure and digital divide are the known major causes behind the failures of e-service implementation, the study reveals that e-government applications have been growing in Bangladesh. The prospects include mobile phone based e-service development, and public private partnership (PPP), while the challenges are frequent power interruption, lack of techno-savvy people in public organizations to look after the systems, etc. The increased number of e-services shows the progress of the country. The paper also contributes to identifying the success factors of e-services as well as factors accountable for unsatisfactory results in deploying e-services in Bangladesh. It is expected that the study would help the planners and policy-makers of the country to address the challenges for future development of e-government applications in Bangladesh."

It is found that most of its public agencies have established in their websites sections for FOI purposes. Of all the kinds of information seen in the sections, ""policy white papers, statistics and reports"" has the largest amount, is updated most frequently, and is most browsed by site visitors. Governments in Taiwan also implement back office procedures and system applications for FOI purposes through use of their websites. Only half of the surveyed public agencies provide online FOI request forms, while most agencies rely on their agency-head e-mail boxes as a major channel to receive and process FOI requests from citizens. As e-transparency is a critical way of governing and a basis for governing legitimacy, experiences and developments in Taiwan can be important references for international comparison and learning."

In order to understand their behavior with respect to using e-government services, factors influencing the transformation of potential users of e-government services to actual users must be known. These will provide policy makers with information on how to develop suitable e-government services suitable for this category of users. This study adopts a questionnaire survey method to investigate Chinese migrant workers' information needs, level of access to Internet, and use of government websites. The results show that income; information literacy; friends' influence; chances for retrieving government websites through search engines; and the availability of a special service column for migrant farmer workers on government websites; are all influential factors for their use of e-government services. Finally, the policy implications of these findings are discussed."

The study presents three main implications. First, people who do political activities online are not categorically disparate from those who do so offline. Second, the patterns of cross-group differences in activeness of political participation make distinctions between offline and online modes. Demographic distinctions reveal a tradeoff between a generational gap in online activity and a racial gap in offline activity, but a divide in political participation is still large between better-educated, affluent people and their counterparts. Third, the Internet plays a dual role to mobilize new participation by offline inactivists as well as to reinforce continuous participation by offline activists. Offline inactive participants do online political activities actively with frequent use of the Internet."

People who talk politics with others offline are highly likely to do so online. Those who talk politics online are not categorically different from those who do so face-to-face and/or voice-to-voice.

Advanced technologies create a communication revolution, and the individual, through the advent of mobile media, has become an active participant in this process. This study investigates the mobile phone's impact upon the developments of public participation, social inclusion and citizenship through the case study of Xiamen PX demonstration. In terms of local environmental activism, the Xiamen residents shared information with the help of wireless communication about the alleged misdeeds of party officials and took various civic actions again them. A rare sense of participation in public affairs is fostered through the use of mobile communication technology. The government must figure out how to improve the effective and regular information exchange and feedback top down and bottom up to raise the awareness and understanding among higher decision making agencies, government and the public."

It is the outward face of the use of information and communications technologies (ICTs) by government to (hence the ""2"") deliver information and services.

These scenarios have been designed through a foresight exercise conducted by the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) as part of the CROSSROAD Project, a support action of the European Commission 7th Framework Programme. After presenting the conceptual framework and methodological approach followed, the main results of the trends analysis conducted as part of the project are discussed. This entails the presentation of societal trends and a deeper analysis of policy and research trends that are considered central for understanding and mapping ICT research for prospective governance and policy modelling. Based on the framework proposed, four internally-consistent views of what the European Information Society might be by 2030 have been designed. The resulting scenarios and the consequent implications for citizens, businesses and public services are then presented. The timeframe in which certain (or all) the elements of the visions will occur are influenced by the technological and societal 'speed of change'. However, considering the unprecedented growth and speed of take up experienced in several research areas under investigation, it is argued that the world we will be living in by 2030 will be radically different from the world we are living in today. Finally, the key areas of expected change and the research challenges identified for building a Digital Europe twenty years from now are presented."

MGNREGS needs careful ""architectural treatment"" since governance expects a coordinated relationship among various constituents to deliver desired services to citizens. This issue becomes is relevant because of the fact that e-governance practices have the potential to contribute. This paper argues that capturing architectural views during early phases of such national level is quite important in order to sustain the established complex relationships among all stakeholders, processes and reflect them in e-governance services architecture. A framework captures architectural issues and identifies possible opportunities for effective management of MGNREGS."

However, all of that was to change after a team led by a determined national, Mahabir Pun, put in five years of hard work and the best of their ingenuity-solar power, tree based relay system among others-to connect the village with Pokhara. The project has lived up to its expectations; it has managed to connect families, educate children and keep the yak farmers in touch: in fact, it has turned out to be so successful that it has already expanded to forty-two villages across the western regions of Nepal, and is planning to reach out to nineteen more. Already, it has attracted support from international institutions-George Mason University, the World Bank, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and Pacific Wireless among others, and it has even managed to infuriate a member of the Scottish parliament; apparently, some villages in one of the poorest countries on earth happen to have better internet facilities than all of his constituents. Many impoverished Nepalese, who had not even seen computers a few years back, now use wi-fi network systems that have greatly improved their lives. What's more, they have adapted remarkably fast to this new system; electronic mail, credit card transaction and local trading by e-commerce have become common now."

This category of rights creates conditions for the establishment of relations of trust between rulers and the ruled and gives legitimacy to actions by the people. The initiatives that are the right are the benefits of accounts and disclosure of government activities. The right to social control depends substantially on access and availability of governmental information. With the use of ICT, social control of government can be encouraged by the possibility of facilitating access to information, primarily using the Internet. The Internet is a fast, relatively low cost and easy medium to use for enhancing the promotion of this right. Examples of government initiatives to promote transparency are Transparency portals. The Transparency Portals, which are present in several Latin American countries, provide access to public information especially in relation to public spending. This article examines the possibilities of using portals to promote the transparency and social control of public management as well as citizen participation.

Accordingly, internet voting commonly faces opposition despite the benefits voters and authorities may expect. It appears that security features are only one premise underlying a system's acceptance among the electorate. The other challenge is to exploit these features at establishing the required trust among the public. In this paper we introduce a number of measures meant to help at gaining trust. We hereby emphasize the importance of taking the exposition of a system's security features and the remaining risks as the foundation of any strategy. After describing the proposed measures and discussing both their advantages and pitfalls, we relate them to four commonly known applied internet voting systems."

Even though Estonia's e-government initiatives are often presented as examples for other countries to be followed, this analysis finds high degree of variation in the outcomes. The availability of innovative platforms for online political participation has led to increasing use of internet voting in the last five elections, while they have consistently failed to engage public in the legislative process. Furthermore, the internet voting can be seen as transactional. It has not made substantial contribution to online democratic participation other than making voting more convenient for certain segments of society. The government portal for encouraging citizens to express their views about new laws suffers from both unwillingness of citizens to participate and most ministries to make new laws available."

The path analysis suggests four main findings. First, socio-demographic conditions strongly matter for e-government use. Younger generations and socioeconomically advantaged people use e-government more than their counterparts. Second, perceived usefulness of e-government contributes to actual use of e-government. Third, the effect of trust in government on e-government adoption is indirect through perceived usefulness rather than directly causal. Those with higher levels of trust in overall government would likely perceive value of e-government, and then those who perceive potential benefits from using e-government adopt e-government. Last, Internet use intensity is highly associated with e-government use intensity."

This raises a question as to whether this population can avail itself of e-government services and whether e-government services generally serve to create differences in government service provision between the wealthy and better educated compared to the poor and less educated. Our findings indicate that, as would be expected in the American context, there is a digital divide gap between these two populations. This gap begins with access to the Internet but also extends to the use of e-government services among those who have Internet access. We see that education and income are strong predictors of both the use of e-government services and the volume of e-government services used. This has implications for the expansion and use of e-government in the U. S. and internationally."

Nowadays, technology offers the justice-media relationship many opportunities; and electronic notification rises as a common media for communication. However establishing a trustable procedure is not usually easy. In this context, the Court of Neuquén, Argentina, has proposed a pilot project to permit the notification of court documents electronically, in a system that replaces the existing paper filing system. The purpose of the project is to increase the efficiency of serving documents, to decrease cost without hindering transaction safety. To do so, the process schema is supported by a process improvement framework, which includes a well-established electronic signature procedure. In this paper, we describe the electronic notification schema and illustrate with a case study. Discussion is addressed to draw risks and lessons identified when managing the pilot project."

Almost all the countries have embraced e-governance as part of their long term policy. Contemporary e-governance implementation efforts however, are not free from challenges. While some argue in favour of convergence among business, government, civil society etc., many feel citizen acceptance needs to be the primary objective. In cases like European Union (EU), citizen acceptance of e-governance services has become very important because of member-driven benefits. In developing countries, this challenge is enormous despite having prolific growth in e-governance infrastructure. In Indian context, e-governance infrastructure has evolved to a stage of consolidation. National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), National Knowledge Network (NKN) and Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) etc., provide the scope for such consolidation [30]. In this paper, it is argued that value chain management approach is necessary to consolidate the efforts made so far. Consolidation needs wider citizen acceptance and value added services are the basic imperatives. This consolidation phase needs to ensure e-governance efforts having longer life cycles, better convergence and connected e-governance. A measurement and acceptance model is presented in this paper with some case studies drawn from India for validation."

Another major challenge is the low level of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) skills, in addition to natural apathy of end-users for online services. Service delivery and access are two sides of a coin. The need to break the barrier created by the factors above and provide unimpeded access to services using non-conventional, innovative means has become very crucial. The paper presents the concept of the eTrade Distribution Network as a model for ameliorating the challenge posed by access to eGovernment services and products in a developing country. The paper examines the eTrade Distribution Network, its features, implementation strategies, business model, benefits etc and also takes a closer look at the eAgent component of the eTrade value chain and how it contributes to promoting awareness, bridging the digital gap, creating employment and providing a sustainable and affordable channel of access for online services to the citizenry."
2011,A multi-level framework for measuring and benchmarking public service organizations: connecting stages-of-growth models and enterprise architecture,"Maheshwari, Devender; Janssen, Marijn; van Veenstra, Anne Fleur",The Netherlands; The Netherlands; The Netherlands,benchmarking; e-government; enterprise architecture; measurement; public service organizations; stages-of-growth models,Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance,10.1145/2072069.2072083,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?preflayout=flat&doid=2072069.2072083,,1,399,"Measuring and benchmarking the maturity of public service organizations is a challenging and time-consuming job as they differ in scope, size, and complexity. Existing growth models often use instruments that are generic, have no measures and do not relate the stages to the actual realisation of the systems architecture. Furthermore, these approaches take a one size fits all approach instead of a customized approach. Although the type of information to be measured can vary among different organizations, these approaches use similar instruments (e.g. stage models) and indicators (e.g. stages). Therefore, in this paper we propose a multi-level framework in which measures can be selected based on the domain and case specific needs and characteristics. Specifically, our framework focuses on measuring enterprise architecture, by looking at the blueprint for ICT infrastructure, information systems, organizational as well as technical aspects, horizontal and vertical integration and interoperability, and rules, regulations, laws, and legislations etc. Enterprise architecture provides basic understanding about the different elements of a public organization in a systematic manner. Therefore, this paper subsequently investigates the use of enterprise architecture and stages-of-growth models for measuring public organizations by means of an explorative case study of Dutch tax department using a multi-level architectural framework. The case study shows that the organizational information that can be retrieved from enterprise architecture is useful to measure and benchmark public organizations, which is hardly possible using state-of-growth models. The proposed multi-level framework is capable of measuring and benchmarking the information at the different levels by allowing public organizations to use multiple assessment approaches (e.g. stage models) and connecting them to enterprise architecture."

The least we can say is that it has not been easy. Though this complexity lessens when measuring specific features for local appraisal goals or benchmarking them within a broader framework, measurement of the socio-economic value of ICTs is particularly controversial. Here the challenge is not only to count possessions, connections or usages, but assess to what extent ICT investments trigger new valued added and increase overall performance. This paper aims to highlight various types of measuring contributions, putting them in perspective within a new paradigmatic requirement. More specifically, we claim that ICTs can only be ""measured"" when the measuring objective and context are coupled with: 1. reflexive questioning (how do we know that we know what we know regarding ICT efficiency and effectiveness?), and 2. modelling design and research (how do we represent that efficiency and effectiveness, with what computing modelling techniques and within which kind of assumption and theoretical debates?). After examining traditional views on ICT measurement, this paper suggests some concrete steps forward in measuring-modelling and discusses the most promising ways to tackle grand challenge level issues (ICT impact is not about small improvements only). The paper builds upon the hypothesis that there is a need to develop meta-measuring and multi-modelling approaches which address macro-economic needs as well as micro-economic indications. The paper concludes by outlining how user-driven dynamics and broader transformational signals can lead us to a better understanding and measurement of critical Information Society dynamics such as participation and democracy, computer literacy and wellbeing, governance and inclusion to mention just a few."

The result is a joint innovation unevenly adopted between reformer and implementer organizations in cross-boundary collaboration. This study extended structuration theory to study the adoption of these joint innovations to learn about the critical factors from overlapping structures identified as formal and informal practices or routines that influence a successful adoption of these initiatives in a context of cross-boundary collaboration. The study used an embedded case study design employing qualitative research methods to a recent case of budget reform in Mexico. 28 semi-structured interviews with top-level officials of Mexican federal government and analysis of various official documents were conducted. This research design grounded the extended model for budget reforms and captured a broad set of data and practices (critical factors) involved in their adoption. The results show that only a subset of formal practices for systems and policy prescribed by reformers was effectively adopted while new informal practices were enacted by actors. Several outcomes of the interaction during the adoption of the budget reform were also identified.

This brings the issue of eGovernance into the focus of Living Lab's research, both in association with trials' structuration as well as 'legitimization' of results obtained in the broader context of territorial innovation policy, particularly in rural areas. A number of potentially testable propositions are derived from this elaboration, which we believe can be taken as guideline for an initial comparison and performance evaluation of extant initiatives. In this context, the importance of coordination of the multi-stakeholder platform is discussed and potential areas for future exploration are presented."

Most of the developed nations are at the advanced stage of e-governance implementation while the developing nations have increased their focus only in the last decade. Among the developing countries, India has made significant progress in the technical implementation of e-governance benefitting from the easy availability of technical resources in-house, highly professional civil services and committed leadership. However, the adoption and dissemination is constrained on one hand by digital divide and on the other hand by the issues related to the adoption of technology. One of the most important and advanced e-governance initiatives, e-filing of income tax returns, is a glaring example where just 10% of the total returns filed in 2009 were through e-filing [18]. This requires examination of the factors influencing the citizen's adoption of e-government services. Since e-filing has been a flagship implementation of e-governance in India and has a huge potential for cost savings, this study focused on the individual tax payer's adoption of e-filing. The study is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model and is extended to include perceived risk and user experience with computer systems and tax calculations. To test the model, a survey was administered to 189 taxpayers and regression analysis is used to test the model hypotheses. The result supports the impact of perceived risk on the behavioral intention. The tax payers are not comfortable with the transaction happening without face to face contact and are worried that their personal information will leak into third parties. Thus, in order to attract taxpayers for e-filing, the government has to improve the performance expectancy, effort expectancy and provide confidence to tax payers about the safe and risk free system."

At the same time, policy makers strive to cut back on government spending by reducing the size of government agencies. These contradicting developments require governments to become leaner, meaning that more (new) tasks can be performed with fewer resources. In order to achieve these goals, we see a transformation from paper-based business-to-government information exchange to IT-enabled compliance architectures. However, the shape of these architectures is not yet clear, as are the challenges that come with a specific architecture design. The objective of this paper is to specify the dimensions of IT-enabled compliance architectures and the challenges that rise when transforming to such architectures. Drawing on dimensions described in literature, this paper compares two new compliance architectures, one in the meat processing industry and one in financial reporting. Findings indicate that compliance architectures require different choices regarding the frequency of reporting, the style of control, the formation of regulation, the type of dependencies, the auditing base and the way the underlying infrastructure accommodates business-to-government information exchange. This paper shows that while the transformation to IT-enabled compliance monitoring helps realize a lean-government, the design of the underlying architectures is subject to several, sector specific conditions, including established laws and regulations."

It describes a managed process of ICT-enabled change in the public sector, which puts the needs of citizens and businesses at the heart of that process and which achieves significant and transformational impacts on the efficiency and effectiveness of government. During much of the last two decades, many Governments thought that new technology would provide the key to deliver the necessary transformations to enable them to deliver more with less. But at a time when virtually every government is now an ""e-government"", it is now clear that ICT is no magic bullet. Duplicated expenditure, wasted resources, no critical mass of users for online services, and limited impact on core public policy objectives - this has been the reality of many countries' experience of e-Government. This paper outlines the work of the OASIS Technical Committee established to address this new approach by developing a new framework and set of enabling standards that can jump-start this transformation and optimize the benefits of technology-enabled change at all levels of government. The various components of the Transformational Government Framework described in this paper represent the first outputs of the committee -- the TGF Primer [1] and the TGF Pattern Language [2]."

This paper investigates the design and implementation of mobile governance (MGOV) strategies for development (MGOV4D). Specifically, it presents an MGOV4D strategy framework to support mobile Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for development (MICT4D) projects in meeting their development objectives. The paper consists of four parts. First, it presents a framework for determining the governance and related MGOV requirements for MICT4D initiatives. Second, it applies the framework to determine the MGOV4D requirements for a concrete case study of migrant head porters -- local micro-logistic service providers from Ghana, involving the use of mobile phones to meet the porters' livelihood needs. Third, based on the identified requirements, it presents a set of MICT4D initiatives that could be developed into MGOV4D programs to address the requirements. Fourth, it synthesizes the MGOV4D strategies that can support the inclusion objectives for the head porters and similar vulnerable groups. In the conclusions, the paper discusses how these results can support policy efforts for achieving the Millennium Development Goal 1 -- Poverty Alleviation, and 3 -- Gender (specifically Women Empowerment)."

The connotation of a smart city represents city innovation in management and policy as well as technology. Since the unique context of each city shapes the technological, organizational and policy aspects of that city, a smart city can be considered a contextualized interplay among technological innovation, managerial and organizational innovation, and policy innovation. However, only little research discusses innovation in management and policy while the literature of technology innovation is abundant. This paper aims to fill the research gap by building a comprehensive framework to view the smart city movement as innovation comprised of technology, management and policy. We also discuss inevitable risks from innovation, strategies to innovate while avoiding risks, and contexts underlying innovation and risks."

However, citizen trust in government and the Internet technology is necessary for broad adoption of e-government. Using a survey, this study examines the trust level of digital natives in Nepal in their government and the Internet technology in general. The trust level in government comprises both relational trust and institutional trust and the relational trust is subdivided into three aspects: competency, benevolence, and integrity. This study also investigates respondents Internet and social media usage behavior and their likelihood to adopt e-government if social media is used in government-citizen communication. Results show that respondents have a low level of competence and benevolence trust in Nepalese government whereas their level of integrity and institutional trust in government was extremely low. Although respondents generally used the Internet and social media more than four hours a day, most have not used or seldom used e-government websites. Respondents' positive attitude towards government's presence on social networking websites provides an excellent opportunity for Nepalese government to harness the potential of social media. To supplement the views of digital natives, two business website owners and two government officials in Nepal were also interviewed. Interviewees were positive of the benefits the Nepalese government could gain by being presence on social media, especially in terms of promoting transparency. Some also suggested that Nepalese government needs to consider developing e-government applications in local language."

The main goal of this paper is to provide an overview of the e-state technologies laboratory being elaborated at the Tallinn University of Technology as a learning and science centre for the development and implementation of e-government technologies. The laboratory enables to aggregate best-practice academic knowledge, as well as the needs of the public sector and the experience of the private sector in the field of e-state solutions. The transition methodology emerging as a result of sectoral developments should ensure the public sector's smooth shift into the information society. In addition, as a result of the development of a new study speciality, efficient field competency will be provided."

This paper presents the evaluation of an international training program for early-career digital government researchers, designed to develop their interest and skill in cross-cultural, multidisciplinary, and practice-oriented research. The program overall appears to stimulate participants' individual creativity, scholarly productivity, and professional networks, while broadening their appreciation for work that investigates internationally important topics and involves not only multidisciplinary but multicultural teams. The survey results also suggest that a short-term (one-week), intensive, immersive, and relatively inexpensive program can have strong and lasting effects on early-career scholars."

It presents e-citizenship, with e-participation as its driving force, as a phenomenon concerned with the transformation of the citizen's role and status from the e-government periphery to the e-democracy core. This transformation is mainly based on three models of e-participation, namely: push, pull and interactive. To find evidence of this transformation the five distinct types of individual instrumental freedom, identified by Amartya Sen, were tested against these models. An analytical framework, adapted from the Sen's capability approach theory, was applied to analyse the revealed evidence. A profile of e-citizens and their attributes were identified to evaluate their role in Tajikistan."

These changes require new skills. However, most Russian studies in the analysis of educational needs have focused primarily on the levels of equipment and operational IT skills necessary for ongoing activities rather than on the readiness to initiate and implement necessary reforms. Such approach leads to: a) the lack of understanding of the fact that IT skills are necessary for the e-government builders; b) the failure of the education system to train them; and, consequently, 3) poor performance of e-government projects in Russia The paper describes the state of research on the required level of IT skills in the world (1), the research conducted by the e-Gov Center (2), the first in Russia attempt to identify the composition of required IT skills (3), the results of e-government projects (4), the correlation between IT skills level and e-government projects results (5), main conclusions (6) and next steps (7). The analysis brings out a direct relationship of e-government projects implementation problems with the lack of specific IT skills needed due to the nature and content of such projects. Using the results of these studies, when applied during the designing of training programs for civil servants, should lead to greater efficiency and effectiveness of e-government projects both in Russia and other countries."

The disadvantage of this approach is that processes need to be defined in advance often requiring labor-intensive and time-consuming modeling processes. Usually, only a limited number of variations in processes are supported which have to be defined in design time. Hence, a shift from static to dynamic business processes creation is required. Semantic Web Services (SWS) can be used as a technology to create dynamic processes. Although there has been extensive research in the field of SWS and BR, there is scant research on the combination of them. In this paper, we propose an architecture based on BR and SWS to create dynamic business processes. Using a pre-agreed domain ontology to ensure the compatibility between SWSs and BRs, a new process is created by selecting the decision services using BRs and composing decision services with necessary assistant services. An illustrative study is used to demonstrate and evaluate the architecture on its feasibility in dynamic process creation. In this way, SOA systems in government environment can create a process with their services dynamically without having to hardcode the process. This can help the organization to efficiently adapt to changes in policies and legislation."

Operation and maintenance plays an increasingly important role as more and more e-government applications have been launched. However, the government is faced with great pressure from many aspects such as human and financial resources, technology, management and coordination. The general operation and maintenance outsourcing model, in which the market mechanism was introduced in the light of the Chinese laws and regulations to ensure the pro-activeness, effectiveness and economy of e-government operation and maintenance, is an innovative and effective attempt to make e-government initiatives develop in a stable, safe and sustainable manner."

These information are largely available in unstructured forms on government portals, publications and other textural sources. This paper explores semantic text mining for extracting service-related information from such sources using Natural Language Processing techniques supported by Service-Oriented Process Ontologies. Our solution framework consists of the following steps: (1) creating domain and service-oriented process ontology, (2) extracting service-related information from textual sources based on the ontology, and finally (3) mining relationship among the services based on the extracted information in Step 2 linked with a pre-defined hierarchy of service delivery goals specifying the objective(s) to be achieved among the orchestrated services. We describe our approach to these tasks and discuss the progress of the work, our experiences and the challenges encountered so far."

In particular we examine the case of one initiative, the WeGov Project, which has as its mandate the bringing together of e-governance and e-society. We begin this paper by providing a contextual background to the initiative, its objectives and remit. We then proceed to critically examine the processes underlying the design of the WeGov tool-kit, as well as the end-user engagement methodologies, which feed back into the design of this platform. We ask how direct & in-direct injection from policy makers on social networking sites (SNS) can facilitate participative governance in its most transparent and inclusive sense."

Two arguments are proposed in this paper. First, the characteristics of innovation, innovators and network structure mediate the effect of institutional factors. The inherent characteristics of Web 2.0 intensify the pressure of institutional forces in the adoption of Government 2.0. Different adopters will experience different pressure of institutional forces, and therefore the order and the process in which they adopt. Second, the logic of efficiency and legitimacy complement each other in explaining the motivation for adopting and in Government 2.0 adoption, this complementary logic depends on the structural properties and network position."

Politicians and managers, seeking to improve participation, embraced this technology as if it simply were a new, enhanced version of world wide web, better suited to retrieve information, opinions and feedbacks from the general public on laws, acts and policies. This approach was often naive, neglecting the less-obvious aspects of the technology, and thus bringing on significant security problems. This paper takes the decision making process as an example to show how, in the end, the result could easily be the opposite of what was desired. Malicious attackers, in fact, could quite easily exploit the vulnerabilities in these systems to hijack the process and lead to wrong decisions, also causing the public to lose trust in the systems themselves"

The analysis aims at identifying the factors that have driven these complex reform processes as well as to reveal who get most value from this system. We found that the system to a certain extent supports a techno-bureaucratic management regime. On the other hand, these reforms have also been beneficial for the individual institutions and not least for the students, in that the application procedures are both faster and simpler. We thus find effects that go beyond the primary goals and can be attributed to the application of new technologies, indicating that such technologies have had vital importance on this reform."

In most cases, the proposed strategy is banning and access restrictions, but we claim that it does not solve the real problem. Nowadays, each student can take mobile Internet to school premises and use it as she/he pleases. This paper discusses the results of a Delphi study, which involved 25 Estonian informatics teachers and IT staff from the Estonian Informatics Teachers' Facebook Community and Tallinn Informatics mailing list. In addition, 75 upper-secondary school students, 13 parents, 6 specialists from different ICT and education-related fields and 6 school principals contributed to the recommendations. The study resulted with recommendations regarding Internet safety policies at schools but also on the social networks. On the other hand, some of the proposed recommendations are in conflict with constitutional rights and personal freedom of students and teachers."

The hotspot detection is a statistical process. It requires a geospatial dataset as an input, which includes two variables for hotspot detection, Size or Population and Response or Cases. In deforestation hotspot detection total area of forest is a size variable whereas deforested area is a response variable. In this paper we figure out deforestation hotspot using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a response variable. The use of NDVI as a response variable in hotspot detection is experimented for the first time. The paper presents and elaborates algorithm that describes the use of NDVI as a response variable. We discuss in detail how NDVI can be used to obtain appropriate vegetation information from a remote sensing raster image (Satellite image). We compare hotspot obtained using NDVI as a response variable with the conventional method of determining deforestation (Land Use Land Cover). NDVI brings automation in data generation and hence it would be free from any bias and speed up the overall process of hotspot detection. The proposed technique shall play a significant role in efficient and effectiveness governance."

While the first can be achieved through policy planning and technology adoption, the later can only be possible through citizen participation. In India the last two decade has witnessed a phenomenal change with the initiative taken by implementing many e-Governance projects. Interestingly many of the projects have targeted the rural community. But the irony is that the people living in the rural areas are least involved during conceptualization and planning of different rural projects resulting in difficulties at the time of implementation. In this paper, we discuss how the participation of the citizens was actually useful in the successful implementation of a specific rural project in India, namely, the NREGS. Further, we also share how continuing participation of the rural community was not only helpful in monitoring the execution of the project but also to provide feedback to the Government for better implementation and to ensure transparency."

Since 2007, TasLab has been a partner of the European Network of Living Labs (ENoLL), promoting the cooperation of ICT companies and research centers with the local end users since the early stages of the innovation value chain. More recently, TasLab has developed a participatory model of innovation, driven by public sector demand, and supported by an electronic portal and a Web 2.0 collaboration platform. This has introduced a mechanism of bottom-up 'smart specialization', whereby regional priorities can be determined by the willingness of local actors to join forces and strive for common goals."

This case study presents the combined role of whole-of-government in public service delivery and partnerships in one segment of the transformative experience promised by the vision of e-government. Nepal's experience may provide insights for other governments in the process of moving on-line, and it can also be helpful in testing some of the conceptual claims put forth by both proponents and critics of e-government as a theoretical model for public sector reform."
2011,Strengthening democratic practice in Nigeria: a case for e-voting,"Faniran, Sanjo; Olaniyan, Kayode",Nigeria; Nigeria,nigeria; democracy; electronic voting,Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance,10.1145/2072069.2072132,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?preflayout=flat&doid=2072069.2072132,Electronic voting;Democracy;Nigeria;Ostracism;Election;Revolution;Governance;Transparency (behavior),1,180,"Recent developments in the socio-political landscape on the African continent suggest that there is still a pre-dominant weakness in the governance systems of many countries. This is traceable to the process by which leaders emerge in these countries often through coup d'etats, revolutionary struggles, but more recently through flawed electoral processes. In most cases where elections have been undertaken, dissatisfaction of citizens with the outcomes have been a common result, due to both real and perceived vote frauds. This has led to colossal losses in terms of human lives, infrastructure, tourism opportunities and even ostracism of countries. To increase public confidence, citizen participation, and strengthen the electoral process in African countries, this paper proposes the widespread use of electronic voting machines and systems in the conduct of elections using Nigeria as case study. The proposed framework relies on the existence of Nigeria's global communications satellite, NigComSat as well as the country's growing IT-literate population while emphasizing simplicity without compromising the security of system processes. A deliberate policy to improve electricity supply and internet connectivity across the country will go a long way in overcoming the major infrastructure constraint against this framework. Furthermore, growing voter consciousness and political participation in the country is expected to result in a higher demand for improved transparency in the electoral process over time, a demand which the proposed electronic voting can potentially meet."

The research relied principally on interaction with the political leadership and selected communities in Egbedore Local Government Area in Osun State, south-west Nigeria to ascertain how CICs can provide a viable platform for increased participation in governance at the local community level. By providing a means of information flow between citizens and the elected community officials with respect to basic public services such as reporting crime, monitoring weather trends, providing information on agricultural products prices, collection of local taxes, e-voting etc, the likelihood of a disruptive breakdown of law and order due to lack of communication between leaders and followers can be greatly minimized. The challenges to implementing such community systems in Nigeria are also highlighted."

It was a joint effort of three parties: a public medical center, a cardiology clinic (academia) and a private telecom company. A critical success factor of the project was a three-party partnership, allowing for sharing benefits, costs and risks. It also created conditions and framework for cross-institutional cooperation, information exchange and knowledge sharing thus breaking traditional ""silos"" approach. Conclusions from the project confirmed medical and financial benefits of tele-ECG already described in literature. The project contributed to discussion on conditions for financing of remote medical procedures by National Health Fund and provided inputs into debate on the Polish e-health strategy. Still, necessary policy alignment allowing for wide adoption of tele-diagnostic medical procedures was not achieved, and significant effort in this area is necessary to deliver benefits to wide public."

It is possible to integrate inter-related tasks of different organizations through service composition techniques to form single service based applications. However, as government organizations function autonomously it is necessary to monitor these service based systems (SBS) at run-time. Monitoring SBS in a non-intrusive and composition platform independent manner is a real challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework for monitoring the compliance of SBS for which a set of requirements have been pre-specified. A Monitor Specification Language has been developed to specify the properties of the system to be monitored at run-time. The monitoring framework has been applied to a government document verification scenario as proof of concepts."

However, currently, data release by governments is still novel, with little experience and knowledge thus far about the benefits and barriers of release. This is compounded by a lack of understanding about how internal processes influence data release. Our aim in this paper is to get a better understanding of these processes and how they influence data release, i.e, to find determinants for the release of public sector information. For this purpose, we conducted workshops, interviews, questionnaires and desk research. We find that the way data is used by a department, the way data is obtained, how data is stored, and the suitability of data to become open, as crucial indicators for open data release. We conclude with lessons learned based on the research findings. These are that we should take a nuanced approach towards data release, avoid releasing data for it's own sake and take small incremental steps to explore data release."

In this paper, we explore the use of open data and mobile apps in the top countries according to the UN 2010 e-Government Survey. Our exploration suggests that, although not all countries yet offer mobile apps to their citizens, there is a great diversity of apps to create citizen value. Moreover, private companies and citizens are getting involved in the creation of such apps. More research is needed to understand ways to promote the development of this kind of government applications."

Others have focused on its impact on civic engagement in terms of community group impacts, finding that such groups play an important role in increasing citizen involvement within democratic processes [8]. Thus, previous research has examined effects aggregated at the 'individual level' and 'group level,' respectively. This paper seeks to reconcile these levels in order to assess the impact of ICT on civic engagement. Our study examines the interplay of individual level and community group level factors through analysis of the data from a household survey (N=717) taken in Blacksburg, Virginia in 2005. This study identifies the idiosyncratic influences at both levels by applying a multilevel model (specifically, a logistic hierarchical linear model). In particular, we verify the positive impact of community groups utilizing ICT in increasing civic engagement. This research will be used to form the basis of a comparative study of civic engagement through eGovernment portals, mobile technology and social media, and to assess their impact on facilitating group communication and sensemaking."

As a case study we evaluate the Brazilian government-run initiative known as Marco Civil Regulatório that used web 2.0 tools to draft a bill of law on Internet legislation with the aid of citizen's participation. Findings presented in this article are based on a set of interviews held with policy makers responsible for designing and promoting the aforementioned project. This article contributes to the debates on how deliberative rules and technology overlap in early stages of policy design. Our case study supports the argument that Internet has potential to provide a democratic space, but public consultations need to be established, funded, promoted and regulated; tasks that are performed by institutions (not by technology or citizens alone). For that reason, institutions are key to understand how web 2.0 technologies can be useful for citizens and governments in designing tools for consultation, deliberation and decision-making"

By building on and extending the existing literature on citizen participation, technology acceptance model and social networks, the study asserts that citizens' perceptions of the intrinsic and instrumental value of participation, and the strength of their social networks are associated with their active e-participation. Using the 2009 E-Participation Survey data collected from Seoul Metropolitan Government, we found that e-participants actively use e-participation when they perceive a greater intrinsic value of e-participation. By further analyzing Male and Female models separately, we also found that male e-participants who perceive greater instrumental value of e-participation are likely to use e-participation actively. The findings, however, indicate that women who perceived a greater intrinsic value of e-participation and are embedded in weaker offline social networks are likely to actively use e-participation."

As genres evolve over time, and the emergence of new genre properties is a sign of a mature technology, we compare the genres used in traditional paper-based media with the genres used in social media, to examine the maturity of social media as a medium for activist eParticipation. We also discuss the usage patterns of traditional vs. social media, and their relation to the public sphere. Our findings indicate that so far, the genres used for activism in social media are very similar to their offline counterparts, with some new genres and genre characteristics emerging. Social media is moving towards maturity, but still has a way to go."

In this paper we illustrate the motivations behind the apparent failure of a process that, at a first sight, looks desirable for many reasons. We analyze the most relevant efforts in the field, which can be grouped in two main lines: those grounded on a strong formal foundation, and those designed to achieve maximum participation. From the analysis, we derive a set of desirable features, classify the systems according to their ability to achieve them, and conclude that no system is currently able to strike a convincingly positive balance between them."

Society and economy has become more interconnected, unstable and unpredictable than ever, and citizens are keener to engage in complex policy making. Within this context, traditional tools for policy making, based upon the perfectly rational representative agent maximizing its own utility in a general equilibrium framework, have been demonstrated to be unable to predict and cope with some of today's most pressing challenges, such as the financial crisis and climate change. Despite the explosion of data availability, the possibility to analyse them through crowdsourcing and large scale collaboration, the advance in modelling and simulation tools for assessing non-linear impact of policy options, the full potential offered by the new instruments for policy making has yet to be achieved. Therefore policy makers have not yet at their disposal a set of instruments able to cope with the needs stemming from their decision making activities. In order to meet those needs the project CROSSOVER ""Bridging Communities for Next Generation Policy-Making"" is elaborating a demand/driven ""International Research Roadmap on ICT tools for Governance and Policy Modelling"", which links the needs and the activities of policy-making with current and future research challenges."

The hypothesis of this paper is that international organizations are shaping, at least in some extent, the ideas, priorities, and initiatives implemented by the governments of this emergent region. Institutional theory suggests that policy transfer implies a process of institutionalization in the national public sector and public policies of specific logics of action, values, routines, rules, etc., in general, defined by international organizations, through diverse policy instruments. This paper presents a documentary analysis of policy reports from this type of organizations (i.e. Inter-American Development Bank...) devoted to foster e-Government in Latin America. Also it descriptively analyses statistical data about e-Government in the region. Thus, this paper studies the most important ideas, priorities, and values that these international key drivers use to disseminate e-Government policies in the region. Finally, this work debates their implications using institutional theory, and gives ideas for future research."

Proper assessment of e-governance projects gives us crucial information on the kinds of changes needed in order to make them successful. International ratings are extremely important in relation to comparing the achievements of different countries, analysing their experiences and making decisions about further development. On the other hand, a country's ranking position forms or adjusts the world's attitude toward this country. This article discusses the possible problem when a high position in such ranking becomes an aim in itself and determines the misdirection of e-Governance development -- in this, the case we have chosen to study is Russia."

It soon became clear, however, that not all users were not getting the type of information or instruction that they needed from this arrangement, and that there was a need for an intermediary in this continuum of services. Increasingly, libraries fulfill this role. Instead of direct government-to-user interaction, information channels flow from agency to librarian to user, from user back up to agency, and from agency to user to librarian. This paper expands on the idea of these multiple pathways of information through research conducted in collaboration with libraries, government agencies, state library agencies, and a national library association in the United States with aims to create an e-government web resource to assist librarians engaging in e-government services. The different pathways of information both informed the creation of the web resource and offered a practical model of e-government, important for other projects dealing with similar information."

Despite the increasing necessity of research on the public apps, however, few studies have dealt with the public apps. Under these circumstances, this study has been in progress with following purposes: (1) to build a 'public apps development model' for describing the level of services of public apps; (2) to measure the overall level of public apps in Korea adopting the development model; and (3) to analyze the factors which determine the difference in the level of public apps services. Until now, a 6-stage public apps development model whose criteria are citizen-centricity and technological complexity of the public apps was built. In addition, the levels of 148 public apps provided by Korean central government were measured. As results, it is found that all kinds of public organizations including central government are actively providing various public apps and the overall level of public apps provided by central government is in a midpoint of the second and third stage. The authors plan to complement the public apps development model in order to enhance validity, and to measure a level of the public apps not only of central government but also of local governments and public agencies accordingly."

Data collected from semi-structured interviews with key participants and a variety of secondary data that were analyzed with an inductive approach to identify and address the impact of the influential factors on attaining the stated goals of the collaboration. The study extends the current knowledge-base regarding TPSKNs into a new transnational context, and a new policy domain, public health. It expands upon the considered contexts to include technological context, central when exchange centers on implementing a new system or adopting an existing system. The study also expands understanding of the influential factors deriving from knowledge and information; organizational; and national layers of context."

This paper constitutes a preliminary exploration of the challenges facing financial regulators building on prior research in the computing and information science community (CIS). Current literature as well as data from a recent study of financial market regulation is used to identify key actors in financial market regulation information sharing relationships and to begin to outline the challenges faced in this unique context and the resulting risk if those challenges go unaddressed. A recently developed theoretical framework for cross-boundary information sharing (Garcia et al 2007) is used to present insights about challenges and risks from the literature and the field."

In this paper we present a notation for modeling the informative phase of public services as well as a set of indicators for measuring quantitative and qualitative characteristics of public services. We further present a prototype platform than enables modeling the informative phase of public services and automatically creating online dialogues to be used by citizens for obtaining personalized information on public services. We finally demonstrate the use of the platform by using the passport issuance public service."

Inclusive participation to mobilise and engage the poorer, excluded and lesser-informed citizens has been the bane of e-government yet, but it may change by including m-government as an emphasis factor in the national e-government plans. This paper considers the case study of the Election Commission of Pakistan, which initiated a SMS-based voter verification system with the central database authority in order to inform over 85 million voters of their electoral registration in March 2012. This unique service is among the first public mobile based initiatives in Pakistan which builds upon an inter-agency collaboration drawing on the success of a digitized and central database."

In particular, social media play an important role in this context, due to their widespread use. For governments, a major technical challenge is the lack of automated intelligent tools for processing citizens' opinion in government social media. At the same time, during the last decade, argumentation theory has consolidated itself in Artificial Intelligence as a new paradigm for modeling common sense reasoning, with application in several areas, such as legal reasoning, multiagent systems, and decision support systems, among others. This paper outlines an argument-based approach for overcoming such challenge, combined with context-based information retrieval. Our ultimate aim is to combine context-based search and argumentation in a collaborative framework for managing (retrieving and publishing) service- and policy-related information in government-use social media tools."

It is well recognized that the complexity, diversity, and volume of government regulations are detrimental to business and hinder public understanding of government. The burden of complying with regulations can fall disproportionately on small businesses since these businesses may not have the expertise or resources to keep track of the regulations and the requirements. The situation can potentially be improved by developing appropriate tools that can help facilitate the regulatory and compliance process. To illustrate, this paper discusses the applications of information technology for selected services related to regulations, such as compliance assistance, comparison of regulation from diverse sources, and e-rulemaking."

The pervasive use of digital technologies has, no doubt, improved people's day--to--day life in different ways and to varying extents resulting in ""economically-rich"" and ""economically-poor"" regions of the world, and at the same time, ""information-rich"" and ""information-poor"" societies. This broadly reflects the differing levels of access and utilization of information and communication technologies, a phenomenon referred to as the digital divide. This paper examines the co-incidence between economic disparities and ICT use, both between and within countries. We argue that just as the adoption of focused strategies in ICTs by developing countries is bridging the global digital divide between countries and fast-tracking economic development in many of today's emerging economies, the prioritization, adaptation and rapid diffusion of ICTs through e-governance could also help reduce economic disparities between sub-national entities and regions within countries. We review case studies from India and South Africa, and compare with Nigeria which aspires to become a top 20 economy by 2020. By examining the results of the 2010/11 surveys on ICT access and income-poverty distribution across the country, the paper highlights the recent efforts by sub-national administrations in Nigeria to advance e-government, presenting key opportunities to bridge the growing economic disparities between regions in Nigeria."

The ICT sector has changed considerably in the two countries. However, there is need to review all stages of the policy and come up with suggestions for improvements or gaps that need to be filled. This paper looks into the process of reviewing Kenya and Ghana NICTP by applying the benchmarking process as a supporting tool for policy-making and improvement. The paper illustrates the analysis carried out and the results from five successful countries recognized worldwide on ICT policy formulation, policy focus areas and policy implementation. Besides the policy process and stakeholder's involvement, the ICT policy goals, objectives and mission are discussed. The institutional arrangements for driving the ICT policy at regional and international dimensions, as well as the implementation processes, policy comparison and monitoring are elaborated. The paper winds up with recommendations on how the policy comparison processes should be conducted."

Interoperation between these organizations is challenging due to the organizational differences among different types of public organizations. Measuring organizational interoperability of government organizations using technological advancements is difficult and often remains at the technical level and do not measure the organizational level. Existing interoperability models and frameworks focus on different aspects of organizational and technical interoperability independently; but there is hardly any single measurement instrument addressing both. Though the interoperability models and frameworks describe the layers, levels, and stages; they do not identify any assessment constructs for measuring and benchmarking the organizational interoperability. This paper investigates interoperability maturity models to identify assessment layers for measuring and benchmarking the interoperability, and propose the measurement instrument that will allows government organizations to effectively measure organizational interoperability. We develop a list of measurement constructs for the sub-layers of organizational interoperability layer to assess the maturity of organizational interoperability. Finally, we conduct a case study at Population Welfare Department Government of Sindh, Pakistan to investigate the applicability and usefulness of the organizational layer and its measurement constructs in the proposed interoperability measurement instrument for assessing the maturity of organizational interoperability."

The purpose of this research is to obtain the ranking of infant health in Java based on five indicators and three indicators. These indicators or variables are number of infant deaths (infd), number of people in poverty (pov), number of infants with low birth weight (lbw), number of deliveries in absence of health personnel (abhp), and average education shortfall of women (avedsf). All variables are district level aggregates. Besides ranking, hotspots based on those indicators are also detected by ULS hotspot detection method, while rankings are computed based on ORDIT, implemented in R software. Rankings of the districts based on 5 (all) indicators and 3 indicators (infd, pov, lbw) are obtained. Also, ranking is obtained based on salient scaling of 5 indicators and salient scaling of 3 indicators. According to those results, the most severe districts are districts 87 and 90, while the least severe districts are districts 73, 31, and 35. There are many districts in the hotspot area as the results of the ULS hotspot detection. Districts 87, 90, 47, 58, 83, 44, and 45 are the worst areas of infant health. This result is important information for the government, especially the Health Department to make decisions for the improvement of health programs. The methods can be used as a micro tool to extend the function and understanding of e-governance."

This study investigated susceptibility of some chosen government websites to infiltration due to flaws in the design of their websites. Sixty four websites of some organizations were randomly selected using an advanced feature of google to sieve organization's websites that have adopted the use of country code Top Level Domain (ccTLD) i.e. the "".gov.ng"". The research was based on some major measuring parameters which are: Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Structured Query Language injection (SQLi), Cookie manipulation (CM), unencrypted password (UP) and broken links (BL). The sixty four (64) government websites chosen span 8 categories of sectors with a view to evaluating their immunity against cyber attacks. It was found that 27 (42.2%) of the websites are vulnerable to XSS, while 20 (31.3%) to SQLi. Also, 24 websites which represents 37.5% of the websites examined are having the password inputted by the user unencrypted while a high percentage (70.3) have informational issues, like broken links which in itself may not constitute high vulnerability but could create susceptible platform which could permit infiltration. Thereafter, some appropriate policy directions which provide technical advice as to protect government resources available through the Internet were advanced. This tends to also increase citizens' confidence on the adoption of the government web-presence initiative."

Based on current literature review and analysis, this paper first develops a theoretical framework on the effect that microblogs brings to public inclusive governance from the perspective of microblogs' interaction object. Theoretically, this research indicates that microblogs have a positive impact on inclusive governance, but this effect remains to be tested by future practice. There are still some problems in current public interaction between governments and citizens through microblogs, and the government needs to change their musty ideas and guide the effective interaction actively.

The twin pillars of the campaign - 'connecting citizens' and 'offering services to their doorsteps' - are considered key to fighting poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals. While enthusiasm for e-government is widespread and a variety of programs are currently underway that offer endless opportunities for the future, in a developing country like Bangladesh road to e-government is not without pitfalls and challenges. This paper sheds lights on the trajectory of e-government in Bangladesh with a particular focus on its current status and future goals. More specifically, it seeks to highlight some innovative e-government schemes and their impacts on service delivery processes and mode of interactions between government and citizens. The paper focuses on some key constraints that undermine and frustrate governmental drives for realizing the vision of Digital Bangladesh. It also comments on their policy implications."

In this study, efforts are concerted to heuristically validate a rather comprehensive typology of u-city services. Using 228 u-services, inventoried and presented in u-Eco City projects in Republic of Korea, classifying exercises are conducted, by three experts in the field, against a most popularly quoted typology. Findings indicate that the selected typology is high on comprehensively exhaustiveness and empirical applicability while low on mutual exclusivity, simplicity and theoretical contribution. Implications for improving the typology are suggested followed by limitations and directions for further research."

To date, its potential remains hypothetical. This eGovernment paradox contrasts the level of investments with the little impact produced and/or demonstrated so far. In this paper we attempt to provide an interpretation of this paradox, looking specifically at the sharp mismatch between the supply of online public services (deployment) and their usage (adoption), which we define as the ""Adoption paradox"". The paper on the bases of a systematic review of the adoption barriers uncovered by almost twenty years of scientific and practitioner-generated analysis and evidence, rises the conclusions that, in most mature governments, the key barriers to real take up of eGovernment are those related to the lack of both a structured policy evaluation process and an effective stakeholders' engagement. The paper suggests that the critical success factor for eGovernment adoption is a transparent and trustworthy policy decision making process and that its key prerequisite is the definition and implementation of a well organized and fully participatory evaluation framework."

This paper focuses on this aspect by means of literature review and analyzing indexes related to eGovernment and the factors associated with accountability available during the period 2005-2010. The findings show that the relationship between accountability and eGovernment among the countries as whole is not straightforward as it depends on the characteristics of the individual governance. However, evidence in general shows that strong accountability, which is measured here through a level of integrity, influences the government to adopt eGovernment as it helps to open up the government and its policy process to its citizens and other stakeholders."

The paper first discusses the concept of ""smart city"" as a foundation for the examination of the 311 program as a practice of government innovation. The paper then presents the details of the 311 program as instantiated in the City of Philadelphia. In-depth interviews with Philadelphia City government officials and managers responsible for creating and operating the City's 311 system (Philly311) offer insights into the contributions the system is making to a more efficient, effective, transparent, accountable, and collaborative city government. Performance data provided by Philly311 enables more efficient resource allocation and informed decision making. Philly311 is credited with making the process of service delivery more transparent to the public, and providing traceability of requested services which imbues service departments with a sense of accountability. Service level agreements are providing measurable standards of municipal services and are used to support accountability in terms of service status. Regular reviews of service level agreements and content of the system are also recognized as promoting interdepartmental collaboration. 311 systems are broadly recognized as powerful tools to engage residents in improving their neighborhoods. Institutionalizing interdepartmental collaborations emerged from the interviews as a critical capability in advancing from the initiation stage of Philly311-like systems to operations and refinement."

Such ventures are usually complex, so they require effective collaboration of a number of autonomous organizations. To face the challenge of efficient cooperation, public administration should adopt the model of Virtual Organizations (VO). A key phase in each VO life-cycle is selection of partners which in case of public administration takes a form of public auctions. In this paper a Collaborative Contractor Selection method, denoted C-CS, is proposed to support selection of contractors for a portfolio of public ventures. In the C-CS method a number of requirements are considered associated with contractor offer properties, contractor competences, and social relationships among them.

They are usually adopted in complex settings influenced by not only IT factors but other factors from different structures, such as contextual, organizational, collaboration, knowledge, and trust. These structures come from the context in which the e-government project is embedded. The goal of this research is to explore the multiple factors from various structures involved in e-government success using a contemporary case of an IT-enabled budget reform in Mexico. This study comprises a descriptive summary of answers from a questionnaire applied over federal and state government officials who participated in this initiative who adopted it into their daily practice. Due to the context of the IT-enabled budget reform, questions about the factors from different structures including the budgeting structure were analyzed. General characteristics and potential benefits of the e-government initiative were also examined. The main motivation of this study is to extend our understanding of possible enablers and inhibitors that public officials face during the adoption of e-government projects into work routines and different contexts. Derived from the questionnaire results, a selection of 11 ""practical advices"" were identified as useful for a successful adoption of e-government projects."

We identified three CIO types: first, the Political CIO, who has substantial resources but less IT competencies; second, the Operational CIO, who manages IT primarily close to actual projects; third, the Decorative CIO, who serves predominantly for public image. Thus, the institution of CIO moves between catchphrase and e-government enabler."

The system addresses the missed benefit resulting from islands of data contained in disparate, independent computer systems. Relying on any single view of the data is not sufficient for effective data-driven decision making. NERIC Connect provides a unified view that results in school district employees having actionable information that can be used to improve instruction."

In the United Nation (UN) Millennium Summit 2000, 191 countries adopted the Millennium declaration. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) supported E-Governance is a critical element in achieving MDGs. National E-Governance strategies have hastened ICT interventions. Recent global assessments on MDGs suggest that though many countries have shown noticeable results in meeting MDGs with scope for supporting sustainable development strategies. In this paper, it is posited that efforts to meet MDGs in India need to have converged efforts at the village levels. This is desired because local development processes are likely to influence the national agenda. Village households being units of development processes need to understand the contours of MDGs and its effects in lives of the household. Use of E-governance supported services by these units for meeting MDGs has influences to meet sustainable development of the households. This paper includes studies in some sample villages in the state of Gujarat to examine the effects of E-Governance in meeting MDGs and sustainable development. It discusses the process of convergence and contributions of E-Governance services to meet MDG agenda and overall sustainable development."

Many are not even aware that such services exist. This is because due to Nepal's difficult terrain, two vital vehicles for e-governance services -access to energy/the national electricity grid and internet penetration - are both negligible. Rural populations stand to benefit the most from e-governance services, yet they continue to be overlooked by government and non-government information and communications (ICT)-based development activities largely on grounds of lack of access to energy sources. A recently completed ICT project funded by Intel Corporation and implemented by Winrock International challenged this bottleneck to efficient rollout of e-governance services, and has demonstrated a successful shift in the national rural ICT paradigm. This paper communicates the experience of a pioneering community-based activity to extend electronic services, including e-governance, in remote un-electrified communities in Nepal. This public-private partnership between rural communities, local and national governments, and a non-government organization harnessed energy generated from small solar photovoltaic and micro-hydro systems to operate power-efficient ICT and e-services. The ICT infrastructure is housed in local government schools, and has enabled rural communities to access multifaceted e-services beyond the electricity grid network."

A number of initiatives have led to the creation of eParticipation platforms, enabling digital participation online via ICT technologies. Even though these solutions have been introduced, the overall citizen participation remains at a relatively low level, and in general eParticipation objectives have not been fully met. One of the main reasons identified, why the initiatives fall short on participation, is the problem of digital divide and social exclusion. We present a study on eParticipation in municipalities, based on an opinion-mining project in an Irish city. We provide preliminary results and our conclusions after conducting a specific initiative. We identify key factors and decisions that have led towards a promising initiative in the field of eParticipation."

In the Indian subcontinent the healthcare facilities are quite diverse as one travels from major cities to remote locations and to the rural areas. Whatever little healthcare has been possible in rural India is only because of the initiative of the Government or NGOs. No private player is interested to invest in the rural areas because of the possible poor return on investment. In this paper we study how modern ICT in general and cloud computing in particular can be used in the healthcare sector in order to facilitate improved medical services in the rural areas at reduced costs. We argue that cloud services stand as a potential alternative to facilitate rural healthcare information management in terms of cost reduction and resource utilization. At the same time it can improve maintainability and use of up-to-date technologies in the healthcare sector. The main objective of a Cloud based information system is to create secure and state-of-the-art facility to store patient data which can be accessed by the medical professionals and policy makers for disease diagnosis and control. A cloud based information repository system can offer new possibilities, such as easy and ubiquitous access to medical data, and opportunities to utilize the services of medical experts which are otherwise unavailable in rural areas. Here, we propose a cloud based model for building a rural healthcare information system. Design of an overall system along with the functional components is presented and the advantages, open issues and prospects for further improvement of this model is also highlighted."

Data collected concerns key information that can improve the living conditions of populations (epidemiological data, environmental data, weather data etc.). This collection is difficult in developing countries or in situations of crisis (notably natural disasters). Current solutions are inadequate, for they assume the availability of client terminals, the presence of outstanding (Internet) communication networks, or they provide a service based on a primitive communication via SMS and data furnishing through mobile phones which are prone to data entry errors. In this paper, we propose a compromise between these approaches. A dedicated language allows the definition of input masks with which are generated (i) HTML forms enabling a reliable entering of data from a computer (ii) in which formats of SMS messages have to be exchanged between the input terminal and the data processing server. The implementation of this approach is based on a Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) technology, and it has been applied to Health Information Systems (HIS)."

This so-called Secure Platform Problem and approaches aiming to solve it are objects of investigation in this work. We define criteria that need to be ensured to address this problem. Furthermore, we propose a taxonomy to classify existing approaches. Based on the classification and the criteria, we analyze the different types of approaches by providing concrete examples. Hereby, we show that none of the existing approaches fully meets our criteria. Thereby, we focus on the most security critical class of electronic government services, namely electronic voting over the Internet. However, most of the discussed approaches as well as the criteria and classification can also be applied to other governmental applications."

This paper applies a multi-dimensional evaluation model to the national portals of Central American countries (2011-2012) and starts providing some of the necessary knowledge about this particular reality. The model was first used in 2005 for evaluating Mexican state portals and has been systematically refined during the last 7 years. The results clearly identify important gaps and opportunities for improvement in most Central American countries."

But because comparable international e-government data are scarce, most reports rely on the United Nations E-Government Development Index, specifically its Online Service Index as a benchmark. However, this assessment only captures national level initiatives at a broad level and does not link evaluation to outcomes and impacts, i.e. e-government performance relative to investment. This paper briefly reviews the current UN framework and assesses how it can evolve to meet new demands, such as calls to better connect investments to policy goals, and evolving user behavior. It also places this in the context of new technology trends, like mobile and social media which have not yet been fully embraced by e-government but which are likely to become increasingly important. Similarly, important trends in benchmarking and in benchmarking tools are surveyed. For example, is it possible to measure outcomes in a cost effective manner? What might be the role of non-UN data and of web metrics and social media analytics? How could relevant data and other information be better presented to countries and decision-makers in order to strengthen the goal of using the UN survey to support learning and improvement? In this context, the paper outlines the next feasible steps which the UN and similar benchmarks might adopt, including how the framework might be applied to local level assessments."

Traditionally, local governments present unequal development, at least in terms of the level of resources and the size of population looked after. Moreover, many studies show that municipalities have lead the ranking in the perception of corruption in Chile. Two hypotheses were proposed. The first is that the impacts and benefits, that the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs)-driven reform have had on public procurement tend to be less than desired. The second affirms that an e-procurement system can significantly augment the level of transparency; however, an automatic reduction in the level of corruption will not be apparent. The study was based on two surveys conducted with municipality buyers and vendors. Corruption and transparency were chosen as the primary focus. Other impacts measured include the efficiency of the internal processes, cultural aspects and normative and institutional aspects. The most relevant conclusions were two - the reform of public procurement in Chile increased the level of transparency; and the greatest transparency perceived in purchasing processes has not shown a lessening in the level of corruption."

Although a number of challenges have been found, the main challenge would be the lack of internet access; other challenges include: the authenticity of information and the collection of information to be posted on the web portal. To address those challenges e-reconciliation can be accessible via mobile phone as the majority of Rwandan has access to mobile phone. The information posted on e-reconciliation web portal must have references recognized and the decision makers have to delegate who will manage the posted information."

However, the fulfillment of these promises is not easy to establish. The socio-materiality framework provides a useful way to evaluate Enterprise System implementation by investigating technology use in everyday practice over time. This study of the usage of the On-Nara system (a Korean government Enterprise System) suggests that particular structures of technology use develop in relation with institutional conditions, and responsibilities of users, as well as associated technologies in use. We argue that an Enterprise System can bring unintended (not necessarily negative) micro-level organizational changes. Further, we found that initially inflexible Enterprise Systems gain flexibility when used in combination with other internet-connected technologies."

This is because a slight mistake will not only jeopardize sensitive functions of a government but can adversely affect a large section of the society and may lead to aversion in the minds of the public towards use of ICT in governmental functions. Several standards have been followed in software development but quality assurance has remained as an active area of research especially for the e-Governance applications. In this paper we investigate certain quality parameters which are relevant to e-Governance applications and propose a quality assurance model which can be followed while developing different applications. As a proof-of-concept we have considered a very successful project called ""e-Counseling"" which was implemented in one of the backward states of India to facilitate student admission to different professional courses. The project not only helped in streamlining student admission but helped students in rural areas living at remote locations of the state of Orissa to participate in the admission process without having to travel long distances. Initial criticism because of unsatisfactory performance led to the present study to come up with a quality assurance model which can be followed for the success of the project."

In order to evaluate the result of policy execution and the government ability of overseeing key activities, it would be useful to build a series of effective performance appraisal systems. In this paper, we put forward a novel performance evaluation management model, which integrates different participant roles, at different stages and optimized the model based on the characteristic of Chinese political architecture. The performance management model embeds key performance indexes (KPIs), and five participant roles. Particularly, we come up with the evaluation formula which is based on the role of the proportion of different roles."

In this paper, taking a One-Stop Center case, I study the government cross-departmental collaboration during the one-stop center's founding process and its working procedures by focusing on the influencing factors, possible reasons for collaboration, collaboration dynamics, and the performance of one-stop center. This research finds that, besides those factors like leadership, funding, environmental factors, resources which have been proved in Western studies for years, cross-departmental collaboration in China relies more on the organizational culture, the relationship between officials (Guanxi), the political support, as well as the government' macro-plan and strategies for development. The role of one-stop center in China is more on Coordination but not facilitating governmental departmental collaboration."

However, building such open systems remains a challenge: on the one hand, the systems are required to be open, whereas, on the other, there is the need to preserve and protect private and confidential information of potentially millions of users. This requires that e-governance systems carry clear specifications of how access to users' documents is managed throughout an e-governance application's workflow. We describe a modular, fine-grained, state-based model that can form the basis for specifying access control in e-governance service delivery workflows. The model consists of three layers: a data store, a workflow layer, and an access control layer connecting the two. The data store consists of fields and forms. The workflow is specified as concurrent processes each representing either a citizen or a government actor. The access control layer specifies, for each user (process), a view of the data store as determined by that user's state in the workflow. Such modular specifications can guide the implementation and the verification of e-governance applications. We illustrate our model with two representative examples from the e-governance domain and a web-based prototype implementation of one of them."

However, various authors have also recognized failures and uneven adoption of e-government due to the complexity of the institutional arrangements, organizational forms and information technology in which e-government initiatives are implemented. Understanding the complex relationships between three components is critical for a successful implementation of e-government initiatives. The purpose of this study is to analyze the complex interaction of these three components by extending the enactment theory into an inter-temporal institutional model. This model is applied in two similar cases of e-government in Latin America and the Caribbean (Colombia and Mexico), with similar beginnings and goals but with unexpected different outcomes. The results of this analysis show that the enactment theory in an inter-temporal framework is a useful tool for advising toward a better implementation of e-government projects over time."

In particular, IT leadership is a critical success factor for every Electronic Government (e-Government) initiative. Most of the leading countries in e-Government development have adopted the Chief Information Officer (GCIO) function to lead and coordinate their technology-related projects. In addition, most influential international e-Government rankings -- like those conducted by United Nations and Waseda University; include the presence of the function in their assessment criteria. However, the adoption of the function entails broader actions than the merely establishment of the position itself. Several prerequisites, such as qualified human resources, coordination and collaboration capabilities, and governance mechanisms, among others, need to be available in government for the proper establishment and sustainability of the function. Despite its broader adoption in practice, there is scarce literature to assist governments in understanding the complexities of the GCIO function and making the prerequisites available. This paper presents the development of ontology to formally define the GCIO function. The main contribution of this work is to offer a tool for sharing and reusing the existing knowledge in the GCIO domain, filling the research-practice gap identified above."

PPPs are complex legal arrangements designed to share the control, risks and rewards of a set of specific investments among private partners and a government sector. In most PPP models, the assets are legally owned and used by the private partner to produce a specified category of services for specific period, and then the government gains operational control and legal ownership of the investment, often without payment. Applying the PPP in the E-Government projects helps to achieve the objectives of e-government by effectively planning and implementing the project. In this paper, we shall address the governance part of PPP in implementing E-Government initiatives. The main aim is to explore ways in which an effective governance structure can be realized through PPP and make e-government service delivery successful based upon our practical evaluations in this direction."

President Park's strong pledge for public sector reform through the Government 3.0 drive envisions realizing a transparent, competent, and service-oriented government. Although value judgment on Government 3.0 is so premature yet, the Park administration sees as many critiques as eulogies for it. The Government 3.0 drive offers far more than what the technological potentials of Web 3.0 promise. What the drive suggests is not really novel. The details of Government 3.0 are similar to what Government 2.0 offers based on the interactive potentials of Web 2.0. The Government 3.0 drive is too normative to make practical results. Public agencies that lead the Government 3.0 drive may have confusion between its ends and means; as a result, goal displacement. Opening more information can impose more burdens on public employees' shoulder in warranting accuracy of information released and security of information sharing settings. Government 3.0 as political rhetoric may be ephemeral with political swings."

The accessibility will be based on the compliance to WCAG 2.0 recommendations, and the usability will be based on expert reviews. Our evaluation results show that the examined e-Government services have one or more accessibility violations. On the other hand, in terms of usability, most services were usable and well designed, thus little work is recommended to make them more user-friendly and attractive to citizen."

One possible solution to the dilemma of shrinking resources and increasing demands is open innovation. Various papers have already established the idea of crowdsourcing as a means of open innovation in the public sector. In order to enrich theory and practice in the field of collaborative innovation processes, this research focuses on the willingness of citizens to participate in crowdsourcing for innovation. More specifically, we highlight the role of expert citizens in selective crowdsourcing for complex tasks in the public sector with the concrete example of process innovations. We examine different levels of willingness to participate in crowdsourcing by means of a quantitative analysis of a questionnaire survey with n=128 German citizens. Our analysis shows that citizens are indeed motivated to participate in selective crowdsourcing to generate solutions to complex problems in the public sector. Although mobilizing adequate experts for complex tasks may seem challenging, we find that expert citizens actually have a higher willingness to collaborate on complex as well as simple tasks than non-experts. Additionally, financial incentives remain a relevant instrument in the design of citizensourcing projects. Ultimately, the role of age as an influence to participate in crowdsourcing will be discussed."

The paper examines how ICT-enabled public sector innovation highlights concepts like open governance, public value, government as a platform, open assets, open services and open engagement. It develops a vision of an 'open governance framework', moving beyond 'new public management', based on ICT-enabled societal-wide collaboration. It recognises that although the public sector can in principle create public value on its own, its potential to do so is greatly enhanced and extended by direct cooperation with other actors, or by facilitating public value creation by other actors on their own. It also examines the role of bottom-up innovation and public policy experimentation, as well as the need to focus on empowering civil servants and changing public sector working practices and mindsets."

Governments generally choose their suppliers based on the minimum price. However, other criteria than price may be considered to help governments choose the best suppliers. This paper proposes a formal reputation model that is intended to determine the winners of an e-procurement process. The proposed model combines three elements: (1) the direct reputation of the supplier, (2) the indirect reputation of the supplier, and (3) the difference in beliefs between the government and the supplier. Using a multi-agent approach, the proposed model compares between situations where reputation is integrated along price for selecting suppliers and when it is not. Results show that the proposed reputation model may lead to lower costs."

The low level of confidence of Indians and world community in the transparency and efficacy of the government machinery is reflected in the Transparency [46] and competitive rankings [49] which preclude effective utilization of public funds [33]. Research by Kimberley [24] underscores the importance of e-Governance mechanisms to free and fair trade, particularly through Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) interoperability and interconnectivity, data sharing through international standards and process transparency. In view of these issues and other tangible and intangible benefits, Government of India launched National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) in 2006 to promote e-Gov services within the country. E-Procurement was included in NeGP as an Integrated Mission Mode Project (MMP) [36]. However, in the absence of enabling legal framework, e-procurement implementations in India have not been able to fully realize the potential of the system like greater transparency, cost-effectiveness etc. The emerging issues of public procurement like balancing Social, Environmental and Economic considerations are also difficult to address in the prevailing legal environment governing government purchases. Based on the experience gained through qualitative case studies and semi structured interviews of the stakeholders, in this paper we briefly cover legal and policy frameworks related prerequisites for sustainable public procurement in India. Finally we suggest a model national procurement law which could help fulfilling e-procurement expectations in Indian context. The paper extends the existing body of knowledge on e-procurement by comparing legal imperatives of a statue vis-à-vis Critical Success Factors (CSF) in relation to sustainable procurement."

Capability models like CMMI, PCMM, ITIL, ISO, eSCM-SP and Six Sigma provide a measurement framework together with accreditations and certifications for gauging capabilities at the organizational level. The proposed H-model provides a generic framework for measuring the sector capability pertaining to the provision of ICT Services. Under the eight broad categories entailing 40 study variables, the model investigated the capabilities of 271 ICTS companies in Malaysia. Factor Analysis was used in data reduction to four latent constructs, namely Government relations, Competency and Standards, Business Development Efficacy and Human Capital and Talents. The study revealed that Government relations was the weakest link, with the industry lacking awareness and knowledge about the incentives and facilities offered by mainstream Government agencies pertaining to innovation, R&D, commercialization and export services."

The decision of integrating IT system within the context of reform program has been taken after Madagascar's participation in the World Summit on the Information Society in 2003. The overall goal of the reform program is mainly to get rid of flaws in the tax administration. In the context of globalization, it is also acknowledged that the IT system plays a critical role to create adequate environment not only in order to improve enterprises competitiveness which are the main taxpayers but also to simplify the organization of domestic tax collections. In this respect, the modernization of management practices in the tax administration impacts the relationships between the State, private sector and civil society. This paper aims at highlighting the extent to which e-government contributes to the improvement of the enterprises competitiveness which are the main taxpayers. In spite of the Malagasy government commitment to effectively implement the reform program, the tax administration is not yet able to achieve its goals due to the predominance of informal sector."

Therefore, decisions by government to directly support entrepreneurs with Electronic Government (e-Gov) services can have significant impact on economic development. Given the current downward trend in new entrepreneur numbers in many countries, e-Gov services may arguably be best targeted at promotion and lowering of barriers in establishing new businesses. However, delivering effective e-Gov services to entrepreneurs in starting new businesses will require concrete knowledge of entrepreneurial needs on one hand and the barriers to entry and challenges on the other hand. Unfortunately, research dedicated to the real needs of entrepreneurs with respect to e-Gov services is limited. This work fills this knowledge gap through a study of the e-Gov related factors that could contribute to lowering the barriers to entry for new entrepreneurs. Based on the analysis of the information gathered from a series of structured and semi-structured interviews involving 36 fresh entrepreneurs in Finland, we identified four factors related to e-Gov services which could lower the barrier to entrepreneurship."

On one hand, citizens, academics and nonprofit organizations urged government to further refine product quality supervision strategies and install new food safety monitoring mechanisms (Qu, 2009). On the other, because of the popularity of wireless sensor systems and mobile data collection and transferring technologies in goods production, transferring and processing worldwide, they quickly gained their popularity among Chinese national quality control administration (Ruiz-Garcia et al, 2009; Jiang, 2008). The purpose of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive review of China's newly installed mobile and wireless quality control system based on the analysis of both first hand and second hand data. Specifically the study focuses on how changes in monitoring and tracing technologies interact with the current quality control and food safety administration, goods production and supply, and inspection systems. The paper concludes that although China's food quality control administration did attempt to bring new technology to enforce quality control code, the current implementation of mobile and wireless monitoring tools still demonstrates a highly reactive nature. In addition, the distribution of mobile and wireless monitoring device is still very uneven when it comes to different types of food. This to certain extent prevents the government from employing the new tools to their full extent to establish a meaningful monitoring system for further food quality crisis prevention."

Role of women in overall development of society needs no debate. In India, women who constitute almost half of the population are integral part of overall development of the nation and policies are abundant to support the cause though a lot is still needed to be accomplished. One of the major challenges at the hands of policy makers and implementers is to empower the women and especially in rural India. Rural India is still under the grip of digital divides, though overall India as a nation has shown the promises of digital inclusion and digital opportunities. However, these opportunities are yet to have its outreach in rural areas. National Informatics Centre, a national agency in India is striving towards supporting the digital inclusion strategies of India with active deployment of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enabled services. In this paper, it is argued that digital inclusion outreach is better achieved through collaborative and group based approaches and thus Women Self-Help Groups (WSHGs) show these promises. This paper presents the success story of some women WSHGs in Ganjam district of Odisha province by introducing web-based applications for better dissemination of information regarding their products and performance."

In the present context, the role of education in building a smart society cannot be overlooked. There is growing demand for quality education across all sections of society, irrespective of economic, ethnic, and geographical diversities. In order to cope up with the demand it is envisaged that the cloud computing paradigm can provide a technological solution in terms of resource utilization and scalability. In this paper, we have explicated the evolution of Indian education system and the ever growing challenge to foster ""quality education for all"". We elucidate how cloud enabled education can redefine the education landscape in India. We have presented a cloud enabled model for maintaining and disseminating academic contents, and a variety of student related services. We believe that the National Knowledge Network (NKN), which is a Government of India initiative to seamlessly interconnect leading scientific and technological institutions across the country, can provide the required backbone infrastructure to implement the proposed cloud enabled education model (CeMSE). This will be a value addition to the huge network infrastructure which can go a long way to facilitate distance learning, access to quality study material, academic guidance by subject experts and even pave the way for collaborative research in emerging areas."

A core component of this strategy is to harness IT innovations to move towards ""proactive"" service and information delivery. The aim is to flip the service delivery model by shifting from the ""pull"" approach of traditional e-government---whereby the citizen must seek out government services---towards a ""push"" model, whereby government proactively and seamlessly delivers just-in-time information and services to individual citizens based on needs, preferences, circumstance, life events, and location. The article will share how Taiwan is conceptualizing and implementing this model of proactive e-Governance through mini case studies of initiatives across the strategic pillars of: (1) Service Excellence, focusing on the implementation of personalized push notifications to citizens and (2) Digital Inclusion, focusing on the ""Door-to-Door e-Services"" pilot program that proactively bridge the digital divide by physically delivering virtual services using roaming frontline civil servants equipped with connected tablets. The concluding section discusses what lies ahead as Taiwan further evolves this proactive approach by harnessing emerging innovations in cloud, social, and big data technologies."

Data from heterogeneous sources are extracted and related by means of domain knowledge. The system consists of three layers: a data space, a space manager and an interface layer. The data space layer consists of a set of heterogeneous databases. The space manager layer -- implemented as a variable database and a relationship module -- consists of domain knowledge. The relationship module decides which databases in the data space layer are required to answer a query. The interface layer consists of a user friendly web interface, which facilitates policy makers to interpret data flows within the justice domain."

As the second most populous continent, the world's ""progress"" on the MDGs is heavily dependent on whatever progress is made in Africa. Using a similar analogy, whatever progress Nigeria makes -- being Africa's most populous nation- is likely to determine to a large extent the measure of success recorded by the continent. This study explores MDG 7: to ensure environmental sustainability, specifically Target 11 which seeks to improve the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2020. Based on a case study of Nigeria's capital city, Abuja where the Federal Capital Territory Administration established the Abuja Geographic Information System (AGIS) as an infrastructure to support land administration, housing allocation and urban planning, the paper discusses how AGIS, as an e-government tool, has helped in addressing the emergence of slums within the capital city. Supported by evidence from Africa and Asia, the study concludes that if there is substantial replication, GIS-based applications in land administration by sub-national governments across the country can ultimately contribute towards the MDG of reducing the number of slum dwellers in Nigeria."

One of the main questions that arise is what role information and communication technologies (ICTs) play in facing and managing these new and emerging issues. The concepts of ""smart city"" and ""smart government"" might be potential answers to this question, since they refer to the actions numerous cities have taken to face modern urban problems in order to make cities more efficient, innovative, and sustainable. In this paper we analyze multiple factors that play a relevant role in the implementation of what can be called a smart city initiative. Based on semi-structured interviews, this paper argues that smartness does not refer only to the automation of procedures, but to a much more complex strategy, which may include process redesign, political support negotiation, and the transformation of organizational structures and institutions, among other important factors."

In addition, in the literature of reusing public sector information to create added values, several challenges are identified to have negative impact on the value chain formation. By employing the six dimensions of open data policy, the research argues that the movement of OGD can strengthen the value chain creation of reusing government information and data, and the challenges as discussed in the literature are expected to be alleviated."

Currently, some citizens are very politically active and are taking part in the legislative process, starting petitions and protests to stop or support particular bills. However, the majority of the population is lost and does not care much for the details of the legislative process. They get politically active when journalists and news outlets raise an issue, but this is intrinsically biased towards the media's agenda and not always close to the citizen's personal interests. We are researching ways to automatically summarize and simplify the legislative process in a personalized manner for each citizen. In the way that Netflix or Amazon can learn a customer's preferences for movies, books and other products, we have been researching methods to build a system that can learn political preferences and topic of interest and can use these to automatically notify citizens when such topics are being discussed in parliament or when a bill is being voted that the citizen would strongly support or oppose. In this paper we present the state of the open data that is currently made available by legislative bodies to bootstrap such a system and we then discuss a particular use case, Cidadão Automatico that we are developing for monitoring the Brazilian legislative bodies."

Such networks essentially rely on electronic information sharing across organisations, and thus rest on interoperability (IOP). However, whilst previous research has argued that expected impacts from IOP standard are a central factor for organisations' motivation to adopt them, not much research has been done on the actual impacts from adopting IOP standards for organisations. This paper aims to provide a better understanding of the impacts from the adoption of IOP standards on partner organisations in Government Information Networks. To this end, it combines a literature study with data from stakeholder interviews from two cases in the Netherlands in order to i) identify the relevant main impact categories and dimensions; ii) assess their relative relevance to stakeholders; and iii) draw recommendations for IOP governance from this analysis. The study thus fills a relevant gap in existing research on IOP, and contributes a guiding framework with key dimensions that practitioners can use for assessing the impacts and feasibility of IOP standards adoption."

The new initiative, called the Medium-term Information Technology Harmonization Initiative (MITHI), prioritizes system interoperability, development of critical registries and alignment with priority development strategies. While technical issues may be at the heart of this initiative, the paper discusses the emerging governance system behind MITHI that is crucial to guiding interoperability through. The paper then provides the example of the health sector as an illustrative case of how interoperability will be navigated in the near future."

A crucial requirement for such ""Government Information Networks"" is that the systems of their various partner organisations are interoperable. However, Government Information Networks often fail to achieve interoperability (IOP) due to lacking adoption and compliance with the necessary standards by the partner organisations in these networks. This paper therefore develops a theoretical framework on the determinants for the adoption of IOP standards by organisations in Government Information Networks. Based on a review of the relevant literature and interview data from two cases of Government Information Networks in the Netherlands, the paper identifies relevant determinants and conceptually groups them into six determinant constructs. For each of these constructs, relevant sub-constructs are specified. By identifying key adoption determinants, the framework provides a useful analytical lens for practitioners and researchers working on IOP in government."

Specifically, the study examines who are the major collaborators with social media in emergency response, what specific actions these collaborators took respectively, what role these collaborators played in different stages of emergency, how the collaboration emerged among these actors, an what boundaries the collaboration crossed? The case finds that social media can foster effective collaboration in emergency response. With social media, various parties played different roles in different stages of emergency and crossed multiple vertical and horizontal boundaries."

As critical stakeholders, the public's opinions on the operation of government micro-blogs are important for their future improvement. In order to explore the public's expectations on government micro-blogs, contents of public micro-blogs on government micro-blogs were collected and analyzed by adopting a grounded theory approach. A conceptual model of the public's expectation on government micro-blogs was generated and its policy implications were discussed. According to the model, a government micro-blog should clearly define its target, strengthen its functions, normalize its business process, and improve its maintenance and management in order to increase its service quality. Furthermore, improving the quality of information openness, strengthening interactions with the public, and advancing the capability of solving practical problems were found to be the three specific developmental orientations of government micro-blogs in the future."

More specifically, the purpose of this study is to find critical factors at the Plan, Do, and See stage, which produce the difference of the maturity level of the public apps. In order to fulfill this purpose, the authors conduct comparative case study on the building process of the four public apps provided by Seoul City Government. According to the research findings, project size, budget, and manager's attitude are critical for the difference of the maturity level of public apps at the Plan stage. Also, selection of capable private partners or contractors for building public apps and information quantity and quality used for providing information services via public apps are crucial for the success of public apps at the Do and See stage, respectively. In the future, the authors plan to revise analytical framework reflecting the idiosyncratic characteristics of mobile government as well as to elaborate data collection and analysis of the public apps making process of the selected cases."

Thus, while notion of duality of e-Participation is plausible -- the mutual (re-)shaping of the deliberations on traditional e-Participation and social media; significant socio-technical and organizational capabilities must be developed by governments to harness this duality. In this paper, we elaborate on these capabilities relying on the theoretical framework developed in our earlier work. Focusing on the socio-technical aspects, we develop the requirements, design and specify the implementation technologies for realizing the Social Software Infrastructure (SSI) required for harnessing political deliberations on social media platforms. We show how the SSI can be integrated with a traditional e-Participation platform and conclude with the challenges in implementing and sustaining this technical infrastructure in government."

The proposal is based on a conceptual model and proof of concept - a Web application. It is intended to narrow the communication gap between citizens and candidates, make campaigns more open and encourage citizens to become involved and participate in electoral debates. This paper also includes results from five experiments in electoral campaigns held in Portugal between 2009 and 2011. Among the main results, it should be highlighted the role of the Media as a driving force for initiatives of public participation during electoral periods, the importance of advertisement and awareness to events involving public participation, and the influence of events of short duration and live coverage in the number of participants and in the stakeholders active participation. Although the strong potential of e-participation tools to reverse citizen distancing from electoral debates is recognized, it is nevertheless argued that the main focus should be on participation and the people and not so much on technology."

The pertinent literature suggests that cloud computing (CC) and technology-enabled mobile government (m-government) combined seem to be the most plausible in this regard. Hence, the plans of the Western Cape Government (WCG) in South Africa to introduce cloud computing based m-government services on the assumptions that (i) penetration of the mobile phones is almost 100% in this province and (ii) cloud computing can reduce service delivery costs and make government services more accessible and effective. Although recent studies have found that citizens and government officials in the Western Cape perceive m-government services supplied via cloud computing beneficial, and thus likely to be used, deriving benefits from the introduction of the CC based m-government largely still depend on a number of other factors. We have explored the impact of these factors on policy-making using two ICT benefit conceptual models: one found in the Information Management Body of Knowledge (IMBOK) and the Access-Adoption-Appropriation (AAA) model. Based on our literature review we tested our conceptual findings with two focus groups consisting of WCG officials and citizens. We found that these models, if used appropriately, can guide policy-making in this area, by leading government officials toward more effective and efficient service delivery and allow for the citizens' beneficial use of CC based m-government services. We have also acknowledged some limitation of this study as well as some recommendations for the further research."

In this article, we analyze the current perspectives on open government data intermediaries. Since it is a very recent phenomenon, the terminology used in this field is not clear, often leading to different terms being confused or used interchangeably. The framework proposed here is meant as an aid in the development of a coherent terminology for describing, comparing and discussing different approaches to these services."

Open government data initiatives generally begin with a directive or a policy followed by a setting up of a data portal. All government agencies under the jurisdiction are then advised to contribute datasets in open format on the data portal. These contributing agencies face a lot of challenge right from understanding open data, capacity to compile good quality data, technology integration, potential apps, availability of funds and allocation of duty to institutional support. There is a need to enable and equip these government agencies with necessary skillsets to contribute high quality datasets. Departments also need to be equipped with necessary technology & administrative support to engage with Citizens willing to use data in open domain. Effective collaboration with community is also necessary to achieve potential use of datasets released. Further provisions should also be made in policy to achieve its institutionalization in the departments to achieve sustained release of high quality, high value datasets over a long time."

Cloud computing is emerging as a new paradigm that provides computing as a utility, and requires minimum investment in terms of IT infrastructure. Thus, it presents a promising opportunity for boosting e-gov services and reducing the digital-divide in developing countries, especially in Africa. In this paper, we present the different aspects related to deploying e-gov services into the cloud. We basically represent the most suitable deployment model, and delineate a roadmap for deploying a prototypical private cloud that can initially offer e-gov services to community areas (e.g., rural communities), and then grow on towards spreading over whole countries, or even the whole continent. As a proof of concept, we present the deployment of a prototypical embryonic e-Gov service, deployed on a private academia cloud that has been deployed in Morocco."

In the exercise the main public investments were defined thanks to the usage of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). According to Colombia's regulatory framework, the development of the exercise of planning is mandatory for territorial entities. The regulatory framework seeks to strengthen the mechanisms that prevent, investigate and punish acts of corruption and strengthen the effectiveness of public management (Anticorruption Law 1474 of 2011; ""Estatuto Anticorrupción Ley 1474 de 2011""). Also, the regulatory framework gives guidelines to implement and embrace strategies that consolidate social control as the main source for monitoring and supervise the public administration, examples of this are E-Government (Decree 1151 of 2008) and Accountability (CONPES 3654 of 2010). The exercise was developed around the following phases: 1) open consultation, 2) targeted consultation and 3) coordination of the plan. All this was possible thanks to the support of academia, particularly to the ""Peace And Regional Program"" of the University of Ibague, located in the capital of the department, who were responsible for training citizens in the use of a web tool for this purpose."

The study finds that the public pay great attention to air quality; at the mean time their evaluation for Shanghai air quality is rather low. The interviewees in the survey also require the government to release more information at higher level in terms of air quality contents, standards, channels, forms, spots, frequencies and languages. In addition, the study finds that citizens' requirements for air quality information vary among different demographic groups. These findings provide government agencies with users' perspective to open data to meet public needs."

However, very little research has been going to assess and understand such change. The purpose of this poster is to introduce a model to assess open government on internet. For such purpose we made a comparative analysis of Mexican and Brazilian portals related to open government practices. The result shows different levels of innovations and similarities on the interpretation of open government. Our paper will be divided on five sections."

The affordability of mobile devices, particularly cell phones provide opportunities for members of the public, including the poor to participate in public affairs. Using an urban municipality, Polokwane Municipality, the study seeks to give a snapshot of the opportunities that m-Government brings to local government in South Africa. The leading research question in this study is: Does m-Government present local government in South Africa with a realistic opportunity to enhance public participation? Community members seem not to use cell phones to participate in public processes. It is therefore argued in the study that urban local government institutions in South Africa are not taking full advantage of the benefits brought about by m-Government."

In our research we argue that it is important to look into citizens' perspective of t-government services because in t-government the citizens will no longer play the role of passive recipients of government services but may take an active role in t-government service design as part of a democratic process. Therefore, citizen-centricity element must not be overlooked in t-government service design. Citizen-driven service is one step on from citizen-centric service where citizens themselves play a direct role at one or several points along the service value chain. By using literature analysis method, we begin by investigating the characteristics of transformational government and identifying its components from the citizens' perspective. Then, a citizen-centric demand model for transformational government is composed and the citizen-driven services component is expanded. The current paper is a think piece aimed at both practitioners and researchers, which attempts to describe and model the authors' perspective based on secondary research and literature review."

Operationalizing such principles requires developing certain capabilities among citizens and relevant government actors. For example, participation requires citizens to be informed and engaged, and achieving this requires government to build capabilities in using appropriate tools for informing and engaging. This poster paper outlines a research work in progress for developing an e-Participation toolkit called WeLEaD - Collaborative Toolkit for Learning, Engaging and Deciding. The toolkit will comprise an integrated set of advanced e-participation tools, based on the peer-production approach to collaborative teaching and learning: 1) to help citizens learn from each other about relevant issues on the public policy agenda; 2) to engage policy-makers, government executives, citizens and other non-state actors in informed discussions on how to advance this agenda; and 3) to reflect the outcomes of such discussions, including citizen views and opinions, in government's policy-making processes. The toolkit will also include technical and organizational guidelines for conducting e-Participation initiatives, including the use of such tools."

In recent years, crowdsourcing have expanded rapidly allowing citizens to connect with each other, governments to connect with common mass, to coordinate disaster response work, to map political conflicts, acquiring information quickly and participating in issues that affect day-to-day life of citizens. Crowdsourcing has the potentiality to offer smart governance by gathering and analyzing massive data from citizens. As data is a key enabler to proper public governance, this paper aims to provide a picture of potential offers that 'crowdsourcing' could make in support of crisis governance in the Post-2015 World, while it illustrates some critical challenges of data protection and privacy in different service sectors. Lastly, with a brief analysis on privacy, online data protection; and safety level of some crowdsourcing tools, this paper proposes brief guidelines for different stakeholders and some future works to avoid some mismanagement of crowdsourced data to protect data, privacy and security of end users."

This subject is of special importance because as long as e-government services are not utilized by citizens, new investments in information and communication technologies (ICT) sector would lead to the wastage of assets and resources. Accepting of e-services by citizens assures efficiency and usefulness of those services. In Iran, e-government services are delivered to citizens via service offices named e-government service counters. This study was intended to investigate the factors affecting on acceptance of e-services of e-government counters in Mashhad, Iran. Our research method was based on applied, survey research. The data was collected from citizens who were using e-government service counters via a questionnaire. The construct validity was scrutinized through factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha coefficient > 0.7 for different constructs of the questionnaire, affirmed its reliability. Statistical analysis of data was performed by method of structural equation modeling. The results showed that, first of all, organizational and social factors had significant positive effects on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Additionally, the influences of perceived ease of use and usefulness on attitude towards utilizing these services and, ultimately, influence of this variable on behavioral intention were confirmed. Finally, we proposed some practical recommendations for future studies and enumerated research limitations."

In this paper we therefore explore the imperatives of timely releases of official statistics through computer to computer communication (C2C) for national development by the apex national statistical institution in Nigeria. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) is a statutory agency that anchors and warehouses all official statistics as well as the coordinator of Nigeria's National Statistical System. The paper reviews some of the periodic releases by the NBS and the dissemination mechanism using electronic and smart tools as a channel of using electronic transfer or electronic governance to make data communication convenient for both the data producer and user for national development. The paper also highlights the challenges of timely releases of data experienced by the NBS and the strategies put in place by the NBS to address these challenges. Finally, the paper also suggests policy recommendations for effective smart approach to data production and dissemination in Nigeria."

Governments need to consider citizens' perceptions of privacy and the sharing of private information when providing e-government services. This paper explores the relationship between preserving privacy and trust in using e-government services and the willingness to share personal information when using these services. An online survey based on a framework for preserving privacy developed in previous research was used to collect the views of participants from different backgrounds and different countries. The paper presents a summary of the survey findings and discusses the impact of different environmental factors on the views towards privacy and the willingness of sharing information with the government. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research.

Data dissemination, however, increases chance of compromising privacy sensitive data, which undermines trust of data subjects (e.g., users and citizens). Data disseminators are morally, ethically, and legally responsible for any misuse of the disseminated data. Therefore, privacy enhancement techniques are often used to prevent unsavory disclosure of personal data. Data recipients, nevertheless, are sometimes able to derive (part of) privacy sensitive information by, for example, fusing the shared data with other data. This can be considered as a sort of data misuse. In this contribution, we investigate how having a feedback from data recipients to data disseminators is instrumental for detecting such data misuses (i.e., privacy breaches). We also elaborate on using feedback for defining and deriving context-dependent privacy-preferences of data disseminators. In this case, feedback acts as a means of privacy prevention. We provide a categorization of existing feedback based solutions and, in addition, describe our implementation of a feedback-based data dissemination solution in an eGovernment setting. Finally, we elaborate on the importance of real-time partial feedback mechanisms, as a rising and promising solution direction for preserving privacy."

In this paper we try to bridge the gap between these two different worlds, apart from each other, proposing a workflow. We discuss the advantages and the technical challenges we might face if crowded source data can be used by the administration. To make this possible, we take advantage of the existing European regulation, the INSPIRE directive, and designed a workflow to implement the rules regarding data specifications to the OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to combine it seamless with official existing datasets."

While administrative use is mainly motivated by citizens-administrators interaction, including politically elected, political use is highly visible during election times, not necessarily confined to these times. In this study we focus on a 3-month period twitter use by mayoral candidates in Turkey, particularly at metropolitan cities starting from the first of January till end of the March 30, 2014 when local elections were held. Tweets are categorized as of six types (i.e. information and news sharing, location and activity sharing, personal messages, direct interaction with citizens, better public services, support mobilization) derived from literature. We aim to show, at local scales, how and for which purposes twitter is used at local elections other than that of political campaign. Our results reveal that candidates for metropolitan mayors use twitter for mainly location and activity sharing during elections times as expected. What is unexpected for the study results are tweets sent for better public services as the second most tweeted category."

Findings show that microbloging platforms are becoming new information channels for Chinese netizens to access information unavailable from traditional media controlled by the government. In addition, the platforms provided a new public sphere for the general public to actively discuss, collectively reflect and systematic deliberate on public affairs and potential changes in governance in China. Roles played by microblogging use in governance transformation in China are discussed before conclusions are drawn."

In this regard, a literature study is performed analysing research on trust in e-government, online commerce and e-participation. Literature research unveils that analyses of trust in e-participation and their results are diverse, and a number of aspects are not studied so far (in particular ICT as a means for communication and as a tool in e-participation). This paper therefore identifies research needs along a trust model for e-participation. The aspect of guidelines for developing trustworthy e-participation tools is particularly examined by outlining various research steps. Online participatory budgeting serves as example for analysing trust, as such initiatives integrate different aspects of e-participation in the support tools."

Nevertheless, current formal and empirical models are incapable of analyzing and predicting the future of the uprisings. Therefore, the conceptualization of these models must be reviewed given the increasing need for a political analytical model that can assess the state of the state and consider the influence of non-state actors on service provision and security mechanisms inside their society. The circumstances require a simple conceptual model to describe state status (stable or unstable) in a simple representational form for countries such as Egypt following the Arab Spring. This study propose a framework to explain the influence of network governance on state stability, it was preferable that this model be general and conceptual. Thus, this framework can offer a more realistic explanation of the political transformations that occurred in the Arab Spring countries, such as Egypt. The analysis showed that formal mathematical models could not persuasively explain the Arab Spring phenomenon because such models are based on theories and ideas that are inapplicable to the changes in the political environment that occurred in these countries. The proposed framework, attempts to describe state status, whereby a state is stable or unstable and it is not necessary for the state to be a failed state. This framework aims to help political analysts develop recommendations for policy- and decision-makers on how to avoid state instability."

Are those with high social media activity, the Governor's perceived as high performers? Nigeria operates a federal system of government with 36 states. each managed by an elected ""State Governor"". This study attempts to answer the question posed with respect to the State Governors in Nigeria and their use of social media, specifically Facebook and Twitter. The social media activity of each Governor was scanned for evidence of engagement between them and citizens. The conclusion is reached that while many Governors have social media accounts, citizen engagement is quite low although there seems to be a relationship between a Governor's social media activity and governance performance."

This research investigates whether this initiative has affected both the providers of the information and its supposed audience -- the public, as represented by citizen groups. To answer the questions, the researchers made use of a case study approach by selecting three provinces as research sites which yielded two major findings. On the supply side, incentivising openness is a critical aspect in ensuring that local governments have the interest to disclose financial data. However, on the demand side, there is limited awareness on the part of the public, and more particularly the intermediaries (e.g. business groups, civil society organizations, research institutions), on the availability of data, and thus, its limited use. This paper argues that openness is not just about governments putting meaningful government data out into the public domain, but also about making the public meaningfully engage with governments. This requires policies that will require observance of open government data standards and a capacity building process of ensuring that the public, to whom the data is intended, are aware and able to use the data in ensuring more transparent and accountable governance."

The elapsed time of a case is the period that is required to handle a case that pertains to a suspect or convict. Long elapsed times may be interpreted as delays in a criminal justice system, which in turn may lead to ""justice delayed, justice denied"". Such a development may undermine the public trust in the government. Therefore insight in elapsed time is of crucial importance for policy-makers to define a sound and healthy justice policy. To gain this insight, we propose a model to measure the elapsed time of criminal cases. The task of measuring elapsed times in the justice domain is not straightforward. Some challenges have to be taken into account before elapsed time can be measured. These include the type of case that is being processed, choosing the starting and finishing point of a criminal case, and integrating data pertaining to a criminal case from different sources. We propose a pragmatic approach to measuring elapsed times, which takes these challenges into account. As an example, we show how the elapsed times of criminal cases in the execution phase of the justice system can be calculated. This example also illustrates the effect of two different calculation methods on the measured elapsed times."

There have been a number of investments by governments towards the implementation of public e-procurement. Portugal is referenced by the European Commission as a good example in this regard. The question that arises is whether this would have an impact on the degree of trust between the citizens and governance, i.e. regarding perception of corruption.

Our main objective is to discern whether transparency is mainly driven by the leadership, capacity and other political traits of the local governments themselves (""supply-side determinants"") or, on the other hand, is contingent upon social, cultural and/or other exogenous factors (""demand-side"" determinants). We test the hypotheses derived from this theoretical framework using the results of the newly developed Municipal Transparency Index (MTI) which was applied to all Portuguese municipalities for the first time in 2013. Preliminary findings indicate that municipalities run by male mayors, with a larger number of consecutive terms in office, and larger margins of victory in local elections display lower levels of transparency. On the demand-side, the unemployment rate and the average age of the municipal population emerge as the best predictors and are both negatively associated with transparency."

Accordingly, appropriate methods and tools for successful open and collaborative public governance and public policy making supported by innovative ICT are increasingly becoming important. Along the demands for the implementation of good governance principles and the adoption of open government, policy officials need concise and reliable information to conduct policy making in an efficient and effective way. Likewise, the engagement of the citizenry as well as of civil society organisations (CSOs) and of representatives of the business and voluntary sectors have become imperative. In an international and inter-disciplinary researcher network called eGovPoliNet, scholars have developed visionary scenarios to envisage how ICT-supported open and public governance and policy making might emerge in the years to come. We used scenario building as a method to get insights into potential alternative futures in a certain area. The scenarios sketched the interactions, environment, technological developments and other relevant aspects of potential futures of ICT-enabled public governance and how policy modelling could be deployed thereby. From initial 19 scenarios formulated, a final set of six scenarios has been consolidated and exposed to a wider group of experts. Next step in this process is to develop a range of grand challenges and research directions in this field."

In Switzerland the energy management is gaining interests the last decades, especially in the public sectors where a mine of data to be processed exists, but sadly is not exploited enough. Consequently, data remains scattered into silos and therefore prevented from being correlated automatically. We believe that these data can be mapped and put in perspective providing interesting information and enough knowledge helpful for decision makers. This paper presents an ongoing experiment in Swiss municipalities to analyze the current situation and design and propose an approach for energy managing by dashboards."

The goal is to provide an instrument suitable to support policy analysts challenging what we have identified as the Policy-Maker's innovation dilemma. From a theoretical perspective, our proposal intends to contribute advancing the understanding of the application of innovation and network theories to the governance phenomenon. Moreover, it aims contributing to the current debate on the assessment of the socio-economic impacts generated by ICT-enabled services, and the co-evolution of technological advancement and societal changes. From a methodological standpoint, the interpretative framework, aims to provide a systemic perspective and an instrument to elicit the links between ICT-enabled innovation and public governance, outlining the various challenges that this poses. It in fact attempts to capture those governance changes which are strongly conditioned by historical transformations in society's underlying values and organisational models suggesting to be analysed by looking at the public value drivers that underpin ICT-enabled governance and which include the dimensions of Performance, Openness, and Inclusion."

This directive requires member states to simplify services and adapt online portals, which facilitate European interoperability for eGovernment services. This article trails the translation of this requirement from Brussels to The Hague, where the services portal was built under the name 'Berichtenbox voor Bedrijven' or Message Box-system, and to the Brabant province where municipalities implemented the portal to improve communications between businesses and state. It presents the findings of a mystery shopping research in which we contacted all 67 Brabant municipalities through the MB-system with a request for information on permits. We describe how the original requirements from the European 'Service Directive' have gone lost ""in translation"" and that national government, municipalities as well as businesses do not utilize the services as was intended. We conclude by discussing necessary preconditions for creating public value by developing and implementing eGovernment services in a multi-level polity."

Though globally e-governance is fast attaining maturity in the life cycle, there are pitfalls to fully garner the benefits of technology driven solutions aimed at rural e-governance. Two major constraints in transforming the opportunities created by benchmarked e-governance services to citizen oriented rural e-governance are i) convergence in rural e-governance services; and ii) creating avenues for disruptive rural e-governance. In this paper, it is argued that convergence and rural e-governance are two essential contributors for sustainable development and disruptive rural e-governance will emerge from such transformation. In order to validate this argument, the paper aims to model the contributions of convergence and rural e-governance services for sustainable development. The model is validated through primary surveys for fitness."

In Nigeria different programs were adopted by different Governments at both federal and state levels to aggressively address poverty. Social Security for indigent elderly was introduced as a step towards achieving the MDGs (1) in Ekiti State, which is one of the thirty six states in the western part of Nigeria. In 2011, a bold step was taken by the governor of Ekiti State to start social security system as a survival package to her indigent elderly. The principle behind the social security to indigent elderly was to address extreme poverty particularly among the senior citizens. Social Security is seen generally as a comprehensive program of benefits that provides workers and their dependents with retirement income, disability income, and other payments. Information and communication technology (ICT) was recognized as the only solution to effective delivery of the scheme. This made Smart tools to become a veritable tool to address the challenges identified in the manual method of prequalifying beneficiaries. This therefore placed the scheme at the front burner of e-Governance in the State. The use of smart tools greatly improved accuracy, completeness and transparency. This paper provides a case study of the use of smart tools in delivering Social Security Scheme in Ekiti State, the procedure for proper identification of beneficiaries before payment is made. Smart tools were adapted to improve the implementation of the Scheme in the wake of identified challenges. Conclusion was drawn on implication of the scheme for poverty reduction and good governance."

Dashboards can play a vital role in performance measurement and improvement. Dashboards are rarely used in the public sector. The objective of this paper is to derive principles for the design and development of dashboards. The design principles include (1) customizing metrics, (2) use of existing data resources for selecting metrics, (3) linking performance metrics to the overall processes and procedures, (4) analyzing the effects of alternative improvement options, (5) visual communication at a glance for monitoring, analyzing, and assessing performance, (6) integrating several small dashboards into one dashboards, (7) data interpretation support and (8) learning and growth. We evaluated the principles using a case study. The evaluation showed that the effectively of dashboards is largely dependent on the implementation decisions made. Incorporating a wide range of views to account for the diversity in public values is essential for success. We recommend conducting more research into the use of dashboards for public sector improvement. In particular the use of dashboards for engaging the civic society."

Given the increasing pressure to adopt open government approaches including employing open data as developmental resource, governments and their agencies must re-assess their capabilities to address these new demands in addition to existing needs and challenges. This paper describes an ongoing effort by an agency responsible for e-government strategy and implementation to develop an assessment framework to determine the needs and the level of readiness of government agencies to: i) deliver open government services, ii) collaborate with other agencies in sharing data, systems and services for efficient service delivery and iii) engage citizens and other stakeholders in government decision making and co-development of services. Major aspects of the framework including the critical success factors are highlighted. Rather than ranking agencies, the framework is intended to be used for clustering agencies into communities of organizations with similar needs and readiness profiles. This provides a basis for shared solution development within government."

However, little is known about what 'best practice' of IT governance could mean when applied to an inter-organizational and highly distributed information infrastructure as typical for the public sector. In this paper the case of Egypt is analyzed based on previous investigations and publications, governmental documents, and data collected from a recent project involvement. The main IT governance challenges have been found as: unclear definition of network membership, extensive voluntarism, vague goal orientation, unprotected data resources, absence of financial governance, and the project status of network. Accordingly, lessons to be learned include that (1) creators of a network hub must clarify goal direction, membership responsibilities, performance assessment for all government agencies involved, (2) participating government agencies need to understand, commit to, practice sharing of accountability beyond hierarchy or ownership, (3) countries with little collaboration culture and network experience are better off to rely on accepted dominating actors for managing inter-organizational collaboration hubs in e-government. Based on essential attributes of the required governance process milestones are suggested for improving inter-organizational IT governance while addressing the detected challenges in Egypt and beyond. In conclusion, more research is needed to discuss any fit of inter-organizational IT governance arrangements to a given e-government context. Building on IT governance research related to enterprises, future e-government research can stay aligned and continue to share the lessons learned."

Under these circumstances, CIOs are responsible for various competencies such as ICT strategies for e-Government, risk management, information assurance and cyber security, ICT budget, ICT investment and compliance. This paper analyzes the new trend of CIO's functions in the aspect of CIO Core Competencies. CIO Core Competencies were identified in the US in 1996. This paper prioritizes CIO Core Competencies and finds that there is a gap between the Core Competencies and real roles of CIOs. As a result CIOs do not play an effective role in their organizations. The methodology of this paper is data analysis of surveys done in 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2014.

Most such initiatives use technical and sector specific Service Levels or Key Performance Indicators for evaluating the impact and quality of service delivery. However, there is no standard Government-wide criterion or metric to evaluate the impact of such initiatives. Department of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India and the National Informatics Centre have identified the number of end-to-end electronic transactions as the best indicator for measuring the real-time performance of eGovernance services. Electronic Transaction Aggregation & Analysis Layer, an electronic dashboard has thus been developed with the objective of providing a real-time aggregated view of eServices being delivered throughout the country. eTaal project is based on the principle: ""You Can MANAGE Effectively What You Can MEASURE"". It provides administrators and citizens a means to objectively evaluate performance and identify areas for improvement. eTaal is a unique offering which works on a data pull mechanism and does not involve any overhead for the user department. After almost one and a half year of successful operation, the department is focusing its energies on moving from quantity to quality by developing eTaal 2.0."

Either because it is a lengthy process, potentially expensive, sometimes unclear or simply scary, people will often avoid or withdraw from a judicial process, especially in those cases that involve relatively small amounts. This results in the giving up of a basic right, with the potential loss of rightful benefits. In this paper we briefly analyze the main aspects that impair access to Justice nowadays. We then move on to look at recent technological developments in the field of Online Dispute Resolution to argue that these can, in the near future, have a significant role in improving access to Justice. Specifically, we analyze the UMCourt Conflict Resolution Framework, developed by our research team, and address the different dimensions in which such tools contribute to make Justice more accessible, namely through better access to useful information, support in decision-making or more cost-effective processes."

IT governance research has focused on governance within one organization. Therefore we first investigate the theoretical background of inter-organizational governance to understand better the formation of such arrangements. In addition to IT governance and health information governance literature we review resource based view, transaction cost economics and social network theory literature. We take constructs from literature and link them to the IT governance principles and to the benefits of IT cooperation. We then evaluate empirically the perceived significance of those principles and benefits with a case study and an expert survey. The empirical results confirmed that the reviewed literature establishes a solid theoretical basis to describe the formation of inter-organizational IT governance. In the expert survey, all IT governance principles and benefits proved to be important for the formation of the investigated IT governance arrangement. Furthermore, variations in evaluations were not related to demographic, situational or behavioral control variables. Our study supports the use of RBV, TCE and social network theory constructs as augments to prior IT governance constructs."

This study aims to further understand how open government data is used to develop commercial products and services. Grounded in the comprehensive data obtained from a sample of 500 US firms that use open government data as part of their business model, we propose a taxonomy that encompasses three business model archetypes (enablers, facilitators, and integrators). Furthermore, we discuss the value proposition of each business model archetype, and subsequently present a framework that describes the value created in the context of the open government data ecosystem. Our framework can be used by both scholars and practitioners in the field of open government data to effectively frame the debate of the value created by the commercial re-use of open government data. Simultaneously, our work can be of benefit to entrepreneurs as it provides a systematic overview, as well as practical insights, of the growing use of open government data in the private sector."

In a country like India, though there has been a political will for the successful implementation of e-Governance but accessibility of e-Governance in rural India has been a daunting task. Rural India constitutes a major portion of the country to be covered under the e-Governance mission plan. But, due to disadvantaged geographical positioning most of the rural areas are either inaccessible or poorly connected as far as ICT is concerned. As a result, people living in such areas have little access to many of the e-Governance services. Besides this, due to lack of education and inability to cope with ICT, the rural mass has lagged behind their urban counterparts in taking advantage of e-Governance services. In this paper, we analyze the factors that have an impact on the accessibility of e-Governance services, especially in rural India. This study can provide an insight into the actual requirements of the marginalized section of the society which must be suitably addressed in order to improve their accessibility to different ICT enabled services, thereby help achieving the mandate of inclusive e-Governance."

Developed and developing nations have progressed in ICT use to facilitate socio-economic development but Africa still lacks behind in its ICT-based development agenda. Africa's efforts at using ICT for Socio-Economic development are not as promising as Asia-Pacific region. This paper outlines the roles of ICT in addressing benefits, trends, challenges and solutions in IT development in Africa. It addresses polices to enhance Socio-Economic development through ICTs. The paper stresses that the inability to enhance Socio-Economic development in Africa through ICT is due to the digital divide caused by inadequate infrastructure, high cost of access, inappropriate policy regimes, network telecommunication provision inefficiency, language divides, and lack of locally created content. The paper concludes that with increased cooperation between governments, private sector and the ICT industry, there is hope for growth and sustainability of ICT and accessibility to digital information."

The number of electronic services rendered through government web portals is increasing day by day. However, accessibility to these web portals largely depends on their user-friendliness in terms of design, contents, assistive features, and online support. This has enthused researchers to investigate various requirements of web users and suggest guidelines for conformance in order to make a web portal accessible to all. In this work we have analyzed the web portals of fifteen Asian countries under different categories based on the WCAG 2.0 recommendations and also analyzed the performance of four mostly used media players based on UAAG 2.0. The purpose of this study is to bring out the deficiencies in their web portals so that improvements can be made in order to make them more accessible."

In Europe, almost three-quarters of the population is now regularly using the Internet. But the push towards an information society also has unintended consequences as those who are unable to partake in it fall further behind in that they cannot utilize online services. Bridging digital divides is therefore more important than ever in creating an inclusive society and to reap the economic and social benefits thereof. This is of particular concern to people with disabilities. For instance, despite progress made in the supply of public sector information and services only 10% of Europe's government websites are fully accessible today, according to a study carried out for the European Commission (EC). This paper briefly reviews digital divides that limit greater usage before turning to the web accessibility divide more specifically. Given a lack of existing legislation or uneven adoption in this area, third-parties in particular the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) with their Web Accessibility Initiative and related communities are filling a void by setting standards and promoting implementation. In this regard, the paper discusses the efforts of the European Internet Inclusion Initiative (EIII), which is building a website that contains a new combination of existing and evolving evaluation tools and support for user testing of websites through crowd-sourcing in order to support greater digital inclusion."

At the same time, e-petition portals have only recently appeared, and it is not obvious how to explain their impact in terms of traditional forms of decision making. This article describes the practical case of e-petition portal development in Russia. The study aimed at identifying the demand for an electronic petition portal in Russia in three main areas: the dynamics of the publication of initiatives across federal districts, citizens' discussions of the Russian e-petition portal on social media, and an analysis of the correlation between citizens' demand indicators and citizens' satisfaction with authorities' work and openness, as well as other economic indicators. The research led to conclusions about the existence of a relationship between the number of Internet users in the region and the activity of people in the region on the Russian e-petition portal."

Afterwards, the results are summarized to determine an overall view on the E-Participation situation in both countries. As a result of the comparison similarities and significant differences will be identified. The results are useful for software developing organizations that want to create ICT governance tools for industrial as well as developing countries and therefore need to consider the characteristics and requirements of both country types."

Past studies also suggest that e-voting is embedded in the socio-politically context informing variations in the adoption patterns and nature of challenges faced during implementation. While few survey-based empirical studies have been carried out to better understand factors affecting successful adoption of e-voting, there is general paucity of ethnographic studies and analysis providing detailed insights to e-voting adoption in specific contexts. This study offers such ethnography through in-depth analysis of e-voting adoption in the 2011 Nigerian General Elections. Using a multi-level Innovation Adoption Framework as a theoretical lens, we analyze the observations made by one of the authors as a participant in the adoption and implementation of the e-voting initiative as well as the post-election reports. Results from analysis revealed core factors for the different levels of e-voting adoption constructs - socio-political context, organizations, innovation and individual. Results also identified factors and challenges that may negatively impact e-voting adoption."

The governments world over are trying to use this medium for reaching out to their citizenry. This migration has been partly driven by transparency, efficiency and wider-access related benefits accrued by automation of government functions. E-Government Procurement (E-GP) is one such area which has drawn attention of politicians and researchers equally. However, studies bring out that E-GP project like any other e-Governance project has 70% chances of failure. Studies also underline that success of any E-GP system among other things, is affected by national culture, project environment (E-Readiness, IT literacy level and technological evolution) and regulatory framework which govern public procurement in a country. Indian government having realized the transparency and efficiency related benefits of E-GP system initiated an aggressive campaign to ensure its speedier implementation through National E-Governance Programme (NeGP) which was launched in 2006. However, recent review by Government of India (GoI) brought out that E-GP usage in the country has been less than satisfactory. In above perspective, this paper aims to undertake Template Analysis of stage-wise importance of 11 Critical Success Factors (CSF) (reported in literature) in E-GP project outcome in Indian context. For covering large landscape of E-GP implementation in India, two representative systems i.e. those implemented by Government of Andhra Pradesh and National Informatics Corporation were selected. The study concludes that out of 11 CSFs, five CSFs are not important at stage 2 of E-GP project evolution, while all 11 CSFs contribute to E-GP project success at Stage 3 and 4."

In this paper we present an initiative aimed at facilitating and standardizing the purchase of IT goods and services across public agencies, through the implementation of a government IT-focused e-procurement strategy. This strategy is mainly focused on the establishment and implementation of an IT e-procurement process, based on Pricing Framework Agreements and supported by a set of tools and training. The implementation of this strategy will enable the Colombian State to achieve a higher level of rationalization over the investment in IT and a reduction in time, effort and cost of the procurement process."

The technological infrastructure currently available in most schools creates unprecedented conditions for improvements at school organizational and managerial levels. In this paper we propose the creation of a complex IT-based information service. This service should be able to extract knowledge from the multiple technological solutions deployed and available in schools and to intelligently cross and process it in order to provide school managers with valuable data that will help them to improve schools' organizational processes and performance."

In order to take advantage of such benefits, developing countries have been investing a lot on e-government initiatives in spite of their limited budget. Extant literatures show that there are only few success stories whereas majorities of those efforts end up in a failure. In this paper we argue that one way to avoid e-government failure is to learn from successful change management efforts put forth during e-government implementation. Based on a multiple case study, this study explored the difference in the way two districts managed the required changes during the implementation of WoredaNet e-government project. The study revealed that there exists difference between the two districts on three core issues: change efforts conducted on the human elements, organizational culture and the commitment of top management. Accordingly, recommendations are also provided as to how to approach different change related factors and issues in order to successfully manage the required changes during e-government implementation."

However, due to a strong relationship between ICT use and social inclusion/exclusion confirmed in current research, this concept has lately become inadequate. Such a complex issue also requires a much more complex approach, which explains why the concept of e-inclusion is more adequate. Insufficient operationalization of the e-inclusion concept, which implies an insufficient number of identified indicators as well as the quantity of collected data, represents a major problem in the existing research on e-inclusion. A multiperspective, multimethodological and multidimensional approach is therefore proposed to overcome this problem."

Despite numerous research projects exploring the introduction of electronic government (e-Government) from the citizens' perspective, insights on the topic from the point of view of public officials and politicians stay vastly unexplored. The objective of the present project is to respond to this gap. By evaluating the influence of factors such as the political tradition, institutional system or organisational culture, we aim to explain the relative underdevelopment of electronic participation (e-Participation) tools in Switzerland. Despite the excellent potential that Swiss authorities have at their disposal in this regard, the level of e-Participation development ranks the country far behind the leaders in the field. The main outcome of the present research will be, in the first place, exposure of principal problematic points connected to the aforementioned factors that impact on the comparative immaturity of e-Participation instruments in Switzerland and, secondly, suggestions of solutions that could open a way towards the further advancement of digital democracy."

In this sense, e-government would be the platform through which this can be achieved. However, as the author demonstrates, this is a failed assumption since it is not applicable to several national contexts, such as is the case of Brazil. In addition, most studies in this field have so far relied on rational-choice models and have thus failed to demonstrate causation, often undertaking instead a strong normative undertone. This study therefore aims to reach beyond what has already been done, and demonstrate why investments in transparency have not achieved the desired results by conducting an interpretive piece of research and adopting a multi-case study approach, whereby incidences of corruption in Brazil will serve as the cases. It aims to go against the stream of normative work and produce an actual theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon, thereby contributing to the advancement of the IS field, more specifically, the area of e-government, and providing a guide for policy-makers' investments."

The implementation of secure and high quality distributed systems and applications is highly required. Such systems can be implemented in a small, medium and large scale. For the scaling of a system or application is required to consider the properties and qualities of the distribution, as well as drawbacks. E-Government is one of the most complex and important sectors for the application of technological development in information systems. An important aspect for the development and efficiency of distributed systems is the design paradigm or architectural style. The selection and development of a framework is an essential part for implementing a system architecture, because the framework allows connection between the concepts of architecture and platform. The plan focuses in the exploration and integration of system architecture, desirable properties and development frameworks for distributed system, especially considering the e-government applications."

Taking advantage of the diffusion and infusion of these technologies, governments are using EICTs to deliver better public services to citizens. However, to address citizens' demands and to provide customer oriented services governments face various types of challenges. The aim of this research work is to provide solutions to some of the challenges, in particular to the rapid development of electronic public services (EPS) and the service integration in the context of development of smart cities. Following the aim, we propose an approach, called Virtual Factory for Smart City Service Integration. The idea of the virtual factory is to provide a framework to automatically produce software based on a given set of specifications of a family of EPS taking advantage of similarities in the EPS business processes. The expected contributions of this research work is to produce a domain specific language (DSL) for service specification and supporting tools that based on the produced specifications, workflow techniques and ideas of software product lines (SPL) can automatically produce software applications for EPS that can be easily parameterized and completed."

To this extent, extensive literature review on business models in the context of open data was performed. Interestingly, scholarly efforts providing practical elaborations and rigorous analysis of open data business models are omitted. This could be partly attributed to the fact that most discussions on open data business models are predominantly in the practice community. This shortcoming has resulted in a growing list of open data business models which, on closer examination, are not clearly delineated and lack clear value orientation. Therefore, this thesis will address issues related to open data business models. This paper focuses on the background and results of my research to date. This paper also outlines the potential research questions and future work."

Focus of this paper shall be on the contribution of two NGOs in Ghana and the important contributions they are making in order to make E-Government, and especially e-Parliament a reality. It is believed that the process of modernizing Ghana's administrative services in the post 2015 era would have succeeded in satisfying the needs of citizens by providing them with electronic services to get informed on administrative processes in a bid to ensure transparency and accountability. This paper makes observations of the need for a radical change in the way that Ghana's Parliament serves its citizens and businesses and recommends a better ICT --based legislature to advance open and citizen-centred government. The paper is based upon compelling evidence from information given through interviews with the Head of Research, Ghana's Parliament and information from relevant Civil Society groups. The research element of the paper draws on the normative literature and current practice to identify contemporary ideas for e-government citizen engagement initiatives to enhance sustainable development in the post 2015 era."

In the context of governance, the challenge is to monitor, manage and evaluate the impacts of public purchase in the creation of public value. The answer has also adopted the information and communication technologies. Public e-procurement presents itself as one of the most relevant e-government initiatives. In European Union, Portugal is presented as a good example. The mandatory adoption of electronic public purchase platforms lead to this recognition. The advantages are significant. However, they have limitations. Through a literature review and qualitative interviews, this paper aims to contribute to the discussion about additional efforts that are needed to be implemented to promote effectively a more transparent and accountable governance, in the defense of the public interest."

Ambidexterity is the capacity of an organization being able to develop new products and innovate while also continue providing and updating their existing services. Ambidexterity is a concept originating from organizational studies, and hardly used in the public sector. Ambidexterity is the ability to exploit and explore at the same time. As scant attention is given in e-government we opted for investigating a case study to better understand how exploitation and exploration were combined when opening data for creating transparency. Exploration was enabled by introducing incentives to ensure that the open data was used to identify and fight corruption, whereas exploitation was focused on improving data collection, storage and treating, creating efficiency on the monitoring and accountancy procedures of expenditures on the government. Other factors found to influence ambidexterity are the availability of resources, knowledge management, data quality management, external partnership and legislation."

The system relies on a knowledge base of citizen opinions and an Ontological Model comprising aspects and related terms of different policy domains as an input and a Bayesian predictive procedure. The work proceeds in four basic steps. The first step involves developing domain models comprising aspects for different policy domains in government and automatically acquiring semantically related terms for these aspects from associated policy documents. The second step involves computing citizen sentiments and opinions for the different policy aspects. The third involves updating the ontology with the computed sentiments and the last step involves employing a Bayesian Predictive Process to predict likely citizen opinion for a new proposal (policy) based on information available in the ontology. We provide some background to this work, describe our approach in some detail and discuss the progress made."

In these participations, Governments generally ask people to give their opinions with regard to particular subjects. Governments then consider these opinions in their decision-making process. With the emergence of new ICTs that are widely spread and used by citizens, Government made a shift from face-to-face citizens' participation to an electronic citizens' participation or the so-called e-participation. In this context, governments need to identify the best means to achieve electronic participation in a way and a time that gives the citizens the opportunity to have a real influence on the decisions to be made. However, the literature shows that there is no consensus about these means. This paper is an attempt to examine, through an extensive literature review, the current state of the art about e-Participation. Results show that social welfare is the dominant domain in which e-Participation was conducted. They show also that social media technologies are the most used to conduct e-Participation initiatives."

The research applies Jurgen Habermas' concept of basic Validity Claims for analyzing the content of three online discourses in Russia in the context of the e-petition calling to revoke the law mandating to destroy the foodstuffs imported from the West. The research found that (a) the use of Validity Claims is an effective instrument of content analysis to distil specific knowledge that is collectively generated by discourse participants to discover not only dominant issues, but also reveal participants' groups behind them; (b) the outcome of online discourses depends on the affiliation and ownership of media outlet hosting discourses. Due to their epistemic potential, policy discourses online, especially in association with e-petitions, can be considered as microdemocracy institutions in the field of discursive decision making."

Extensive digital divide literature's findings show that the chances of using online services -- governmental in this case-vary extremely from one population group to another. Consequently, the groups that already accumulate several socioeconomic and digital advantages are the ones with considerably higher chances to enjoy the benefits of online services, thus perpetuating the rich-get-richer circle of inequalities. This document tries to present empirical evidence about this phenomenon in Latin America, using a nationally representative sample of 15 years and older Uruguayan Internet users, based on the World Internet Project + Uruguay 2013 survey. A binary logistic model regressing the chances of having ever used online governmental services is developed, taking into account stratification and digital divide hypotheses. Findings show that socioeconomic status (highest education level achieved, and adult ages), digital divide variables (more years since started using the Internet and daily frequency of use) and ownership of electronic means of payment are strong predictors of e-services' use. Simulations are developed to demonstrate how diverse ideal type-like Internet users have strikingly different probabilities of engaging with online governmental services. The document ends discussing the role of public policies to reduce the regressive externalities of e-government investments in a context of high social and digital stratification, presenting some of the initiatives the Uruguayan government has already developed to promote digital inclusion as good study cases."

In Bangladesh the availability and use of information and communication technology (ICT), particularly mobile phones, is thought to have accelerated the development of women in the rural population by creating the possibility of a wider connection. Using qualitative and quantitative methods for data collection, this research has investigated the impact of mobile phone use by women with particular emphasis on opportunities in health, education and livelihood. A sample of 99 women from three rural villages in Bangladesh showed that mobile phones provide easy access to health related services. Although impact on facilitating girls' education appears to be limited, mobile phones have an indirect effect in ensuring security for girls. Respondents confirmed that their overall living standards have improved due to access to information on economic and income earning opportunities. These rural women also feel independent and empowered by access to a mobile phone. It can be argued that mobile phone technology can facilitate improvements in the living standards of rural women, which contribute to their personal development. Finally, the paper suggests that wide and innovative utilization of ICT is needed to accelerate development of women in the rural population with the help of low-cost mobile phone technology."

This paper presents the results of a national survey of public libraries in the United States as a community-based agency for building digitally inclusive communities. The paper finds that U.S. public libraries provide essential services such as free access to Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), broadband, digital literacy skills, and facilitate access to economic, learning, health, and civic engagement opportunities -- all key aspects of Digital Inclusion (DI). The paper also finds that there is a relationship between the physical space and the ability of libraries to provide digital services. Finally, the paper outlines the need for additional research, particularly in the area of the impact of library DI services on the UN Sustainability Goals (e.g., poverty, equity, and inclusion)."

Unlike the ""standard"" provisions, innovations in digital public service delivery are open-ended -- new forms may continuously emerge in response to new policy demands and technological progress, and are non-linear -- one innovation may or may not depend on others. The framework builds on the foundations of public sector innovation and Digital Government Evolution model. In line with the latter, the paper equips each innovation with sharp logical characterization, body of research literature and real-life cases from around the world to simultaneously serve the illustration and validation goals. The paper also identifies some policy implications of the framework, covering a broad range of issues from infrastructure, capacity, eco-system and partnerships, to inclusion, value, channels, security, privacy and authentication."

Many experts have particularly defined digital diplomacy as an electronic component of public diplomacy. Although digital diplomacy is an emerging new field with a wide range of important applications in international relations, only a few previous studies have been conducted in this area. This has contributed to a significant research gap. The primary aim of this paper is to provide an analysis of the current e-diplomacy studies based on a systematic literature review research methodology. The results have highlighted two key findings. Firstly, most of the previous studies have been primarily conducted in North America and Europe. Secondly, the majority of studies adopted qualitative methods to gather new empirical evidence to support existing literature and develop new propositions on e-Diplomacy. Finally, based on the findings, the paper highlights a few areas in which further research may be needed in order to help develop the emerging concept of e-Diplomacy."

Crowdfunding is also a political instrument in the hands of advocatory movements that efficiently disseminate ideas, concepts and information in ways never explore before through ""traditional"" information and communication channels. Crowdfunding is also becoming a channel of activating social capital. Besides the crowdfunding allows people to participate in the design, the improvement, the dissemination and the financing of the political and social campaigns, increasing hence the social capital of advocacy movements. The significant higher rate of success of those projects launched by advocatory movements, as compared to the general success rate of crowdfunding observed, suggest that the high level of engagement and involvement generated by social movements are crucial to understand success in Crowdfunding practices in general, and especially among social movements. Spain constitutes a conspicuous case study to explore the Crowdfudning-Advocatory movement nexus given the strong social-economic effects of the economic crisis and the quick and efficient reaction on the part of civil society movements."

According to research funded by the European Commission, the policies of international organizations rarely refer to the potential of social innovation, neither generally nor in the context of achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. However, a huge number of initiatives around the global are successfully using social innovation approaches, but most do so without using this term. They thereby do not fully understand the potential and strength that a more systematic deployment of social innovation theories, methods and practices could bring. This paper aims to at least partially redress this balance by reporting on evidence derived from the on-going empirical and theoretical research undertaken by the SI-DRIVE research project in relation to policy reduction and sustainable development, in particular by focusing on the governance and policy implications."

This work explores the affordances of the social media platform as a more natural platform to support not only C2G, but also Citizen-to-Citizen services (C2C) and Intermediary-to-Government (I2G) services. By considering a set of concrete C2C and C2G initiatives, we determine 1) the extent to which social media platform affordances support these initiatives, 2) the relative advantage of using these social media platforms over traditional government websites. Insights from this work should help in moving Government Social Media policies to cover the use of social media channels for C2C, C2G and I2G services."

However, despite the recently adoption of social media the lack of citizens' involvement in e-Participation initiatives still remains. This ongoing research paper aims at producing a general overview of e-Participation through social media. So far, the latest research works on such topic have been predominantly focused on a political context of e-Participation, where politicians-citizens interactions and activities are the central interest of the studies. Little existing studies investigate e-Participation in its own right in government context. The findings also reveal that the majority of e-Participation through social media initiatives are more informative than interactive, since few initiatives have been found that aim to considerably enhance citizen participation in policy decision making."

Applying open standards contributed to the achievement of a reusable and interoperable datahub for mobile tourisms. The organized working groups delivered in a re-usable formal specification and serialization of the domain model that is immediately usable for building mobile tourism applications. This increased the awareness and lead to semantic convergence which is forming a regional foundation to develop sustainable mobile guides for tourism."

Not being able to (completely) satisfy the Open Data requirements may have made such organizations to appear incompliant with the ideals and objectives of Open Data, despite their full commitments and efforts for data opening. In this contribution we propose a new paradigm -- called Semi-Open Data paradigm -- in order to frame, acknowledge, and encourage such initiatives and efforts that strive along the Open Data objectives but do not comply with Open Data requirements completely due to some practical constraints. For the proposed Semi-Open Data paradigm we further present an assessment method to measure and categorize Semi-Open Data initiatives objectively. This method offers a better way to assess and reward the extent of organizations' efforts to meet the Open Data characteristics than the current method that checks whether all Open Data requirements are met or not (i.e., by making a binary decision)."

Drawing on interviews with 12 private companies we investigate which barriers are predominant in the commercial use of open government data. Barriers were found mostly in the dimensions of data accessibility, data usability, and interaction. We briefly explore the impact that these barrier can have on the firm, and finally provide suggestions on aspects that can be explored by both governments and firms to improve use of open government data. Our work aims to extend the existing understanding of the commercial use of open government data, as well as to provide insights to both firm managers and government officials in the implementation of open government data strategies."

One particular challenge associated to urban population growth refers to transportation systems, and as an approach to face it, governments are investing significant efforts enhancing public transport services. An important aspect of public transport is ensuring that licensing of such services fulfill existing government regulations. Due to the differences in government regulations, and to the difficulties in ensuring the fulfillment of their specific features, many local governments develop tailored Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions to automate the licensing of public transport services. In this paper we propose an ontology for licensing such services following the REFSENO methodology. In particular, the ontology captures common concepts involved in the application and processing stage of licensing public bus passenger services. The main contribution of the proposed ontology is to define a common vocabulary to share knowledge between domain experts and software engineers, and to support the definition of a software product line for families of public transport licensing services."

Despite increasing ""citizen participation"" in the discourse, there is very little debate on their socio-political implications. While some argue that ICT will enhance democratic debate and empower citizens [45, 18, 8], others concern about the development of Smart Cities ""without critical discussions and 'politics'"" [55, 5, 53] and notice the lack of attention for the politics of technical choices. This applies in particular to Smart Cities, since they require citizens to change behaviour according to quantitative targets and technological features. Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) launched its Smart City project in 2010. The government set specific criteria in order to ensure the ""participation of all the stakeholders"" (among which the citizens) and the ""lifestyle innovation"" [22]. The paper analyses information provided by semi-structured interviews to stakeholders of Japanese Smart Cities; the tools of citizen involvement proved effective in promoting cooperation and achieving significant outcomes in terms of energy consumption reductions, this involvement has not allowed any political debate about core issues such as Smart City, sustainability, and policies. METI and Japanese Smart Cities risk the potential for social innovation [7]. Research on behaviour change and sustainability also suggests that such situation is likely to hinder more significant shift towards sustainable lifestyles [56, 50]. Drawing on analysis of official documents as well as on interviews with each of the four Smart Communities' stakeholders, the paper explains that very little input is expected from Japanese citizens. Instead, ICTs are used by municipalities and electric utilities to steer project participants and to change their behaviour. The objective of Smart Communities would not be to involve citizens in city governance, but rather to make them participate in the co-production of public services, mainly energy production and distribution."

This paper introduces the use of fuzzy profiles that include both, static and dynamic components. The dynamic profile generation contains different elements such as, context-aware information and privacy and trust concerns of users in order to provide different types of output recommendations and visualizations. Then, the system architecture and a prototype implementation of the extended VAA platform are presented. Furthermore, conclusions and outlook for future work will be discussed."

Recommender systems have been proposed to deliver users with the most interesting information service thereby addressing the information overload problem. In this paper, we focus on the implementation of a recommender system in an e-Government context to provide personalized G2C e-services. The proposed approach combines the expert pre-defined categorization of the e-government services and the citizens rating history to identify the relevant services for the active citizen. The efficiency of the proposed e-Government services personalization method is studied via a comparative study with the benchmark item-based and a state-of-the-art recommender system for Government-to-Business e-services. Experimental results show a considerable improvement for the proposed recommendation approach in term of performance and accuracy."

In reality, the responders are often faced with information overload, incomplete information, or a combination of both. This hampers their decision-making process, workflow, situational awareness and, consequently, effective execution of collaborative crisis response. Therefore, getting the right information to the right person at the right time is of crucial importance. The task of processing all data during crisis response situations and determining for whom at a particular moment the information is relevant is not straightforward. When developing an information system to support this task, some important challenges have to be taken into account. These challenges relate to the structure and truthfulness of the used data, the assessment of information relevance, and the dissemination of relevant information in time. While methods and techniques from big data can be used to collect and integrate data, machine learning can be used to build a model for relevance assessments. An example implementation of such a framework of big data is the TAID software system that collects and integrates data communicated between first responders and may send information to crisis responders that were not addressed in the initial communication. As an example of the impact of TAID on crisis response, we show its effect in a simulated crisis response scenario."

However, the lack of standards and common evaluation criteria still hinders the development of appropriate tools and the materialization of the appointed benefits. In this paper, we present a model to analyse government initiatives to publish budget data. We identify the main features of these initiatives with a double objective: (i) to drive a structured analysis, relating some dimensions to their possible impacts, and (ii) to derive characterization attributes to compare initiatives based on each dimension. We define use perspectives and analyse some initiatives using this model. We conclude that, in order to favour use perspectives, special attention must be given to user feedback, semantics standards and linking possibilities."

Regarding technologies that enable transparency, openness and outside participation (those usually associated with the term Open Government), not only a limited knowledge of the relevant technologies and capabilities, but also cultural and organizational factors can hinder their implementation. In this study we analyze such factors and ask about their relevance in the German speaking region. In the working group Open Government in the interdisciplinary research cooperation ISPRAT e.V. researchers used a methodological mix of qualitative and quantitative data. Four focus groups and six telephone interviews within different levels of management in the public sector were conducted to identify the relevant factors. Furthermore, a representative quantitative survey was extended by study-specific questions. As result, three key areas regarding the potential cultural and organizational barriers are presented: information cultures and divergent interests in agencies, limited innovation potential in organizational cultures and limited communication of strategies. From this analysis, further implications and some recommendations are derived."

The development of a new Data Center, the knowledge of more than four years working in virtualized platforms, and the rise of tools that have the potential to generate multi-client and self-managed environments, have contributed to the success of this project of deploying the first Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solution in the State. The design of the solution, the selection of tools, the lessons learned and best practices are some of the issues covered in this document."

However, most of the debates focus on the technology imperatives and / or strategic choices view. The micro-process of institutionalisation involving interplays between actors and structures in forming an institutionalised approach is hardly brought to the surface. Complex structure of government institutions, interaction of actors from various contexts and integration of multiple resources during DEST implementation has made the process of institutionalisation difficult. Combination of Institutional Theory (IT) and Structuration Theory (ST) concepts are used in this paper to examine an exemplar DEST project in the UK -- 'Tell Us Once' (TUO). Findings show that actors and structures played significant roles throughout the institutionalisation stages. The actors reinforced or modified existing structures to suit their actions, and in return, the structure governed the actors' actions, to form desired behaviour. This social phenomenon happened recursively over period of time until a common practice emerged and the desired objective is achieved. The findings provide useful insights on good institutionalisation practices concerning the role of actors and structures within the institutionalisation process."

Nevertheless, ensuring the consistency of transactions stills remains an open issue. While database transactional protocols (such as two-phase-commit) have been largely applied to enforce data consistency in distributed database systems, they have a limited application in SOA-based environments. Furthermore, providing users a consistent view of the executed business processes requires, among others, using a process notation including transactions as first-class element as well as exception handling mechanisms to address some of these problems. It also requires applying design and modeling best practices and execution guidelines, such as process patterns, to obtain business process models with the desired quality characteristics. This paper addresses these issues and sketches a proposal for business process and data consistency mechanisms to be applied in an e-Government environment."

The burden tends to increase with new forms of public governance that rely less on direct decisions and actions undertaken by traditional government bureaucracies, and more on government creating and regulating the environment for other, non-state actors to jointly address public needs. Based on the reviews of research and policy literature, this paper explores administrative burden as a policy problem, presents how Digital Government (DG) could be applied to address this problem, and identifies societal adoption, organizational readiness and other conditions under which DG can be an effective tool for Administrative Burden Reduction (ABR). Finally, the paper tracks ABR to the latest Contextualization stage in the DG evolution, and discusses possible development approaches and technological potential of pursuing ABR through DG."

The lack of common data standards (common data models and reference data) for exchanging information between administrations in a cross-domain and/or cross-border setting stands in the way of digital public services and automated flow of information between public administrations. Core data models address this issue, but are often created within the closed environment of a country or region and within one policy domain. A lack of insight exists in understanding and managing the life-cycle of these initiatives on public administration information systems for data modelling and data exchange. In this paper, we outline state-of-the-art implementations and vocabularies linked to the core data models. In particular we inventoried and selected existing core data models and identified tendencies in current practices based on the criteria creation, use, maintenance and coordination. Based on the analysis, this survey suggest research directions for policy and information management studies pointing to best practices regarding core data model implementations and their role in linking isolated data silos within a cross-country context. Finally we highlight the differences in their coordination and maintenance, depending on the state of creation and use."

Studies critical to advancing what is known, have focused primarily on information sharing and integration among government entities at the same level of government or between governments from different levels. Within the context of government regulation, information sharing typically occurs among a more diverse network of actors and processes with overlapping regulatory responsibilities and information needs. The variety of actors and overlapping regulatory relationships can contribute to a gap between the level and nature of information sharing required for individual actors to meet their obligations. This ongoing research paper looks at the socio-technical nature of information sharing among public and private sector actors and examines what is known about public-public and private-private CBIS sector in order to inform future research.."

Uruguay is divided into 19 provinces where Governmental Organizations, which are proceedings' and service providers, are concentrated mainly in the 19 capital cities. This means that a large number of population must go from their domicile to the different offices in order to carry out a proceeding. The Citizen Service Strategy seeks to bring the State closer to citizens by shortening distances, eliminating technological and/or accessibility barriers, providing proceedings and services that may allow narrowing the existing gap between capital cities and smaller towns or remote communities, thus supplementing what they offer nowadays. These services are offered through different service channels so that the citizen may choose the one that he/she prefers or the one that matches his/her possibilities, resources or knowledge. AGESIC develops this strategy by using the technological tools available and joining forces with different Organizations so that their proceedings may be available throughout the country, whether by phone at 0800 INFO; by e-mail at the address: atencionciudadana@agesic.gub.uy, or in person through the setting up of Citizen Service Stands -- PAC in over 115 locations throughout the country, locations situated mostly in small and remote communities."

Meanwhile, the literature on non-democratic states largely views its role as an influencer of bottom-up collective action or as a top-down channel for service delivery. In such ""closed"" settings, the influence of social media on policymaking is not thoroughly addressed. Do participatory social media applications affect policymaking in non-democracies, beyond the two prevailing views? This paper explores this question by extracting lessons from the UAE's ""national brainstorming session""; a rare large-scale social media initiative for policy formulation in a region not much used to public engagement in governance. Based on an in-depth case study, the findings suggest that social media can influence policy formulation in non-democratic settings; highlighting an area for further research."

Developing and developed countries are coming up with initiatives for its implementation. However, eGov benefits are not universally enjoyed, to some it is seemingly a paradox. Despite a vast amount of research in the eGov field, past researches on eGov emphasize on the lack of theoretical lenses, methodical and methodological shortcomings in presenting the status of eGov. Particular to the Governments in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) is that they share a socio-technical context. The eGov frameworks that are used by the SADC member states do not take into consideration the peculiarity of this community; and consequently has led to the continued low adoption of eGov from the perspectives of both the supply and the demand sides. This study, therefore explores the factors that influence and pursue possibilities that promote eGov adoption in the southern African community. This study will be approached from the lenses of Technology Acceptance Mode (TAM)l, the Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and Innovation Translation (InT) coupled with design thinking to align the designer expertise with the user needs. A mixed method approach will be used. As a consequence of this paper, a context based framework for implementing eGov strategy will be presented to facilitate the decision making needed for the implementation of the initiatives in the region."

In fact, individuals are increasingly using cell phones to access information and this trend is becoming stronger with the improvement of long-range technologies and the high penetration of mobile devices in developing countries. However, their use to deliver government services to citizens remains generally low. This research argues that the government use of Short Message Service to offer information and services to citizens is low due to a lack of a clear and actionable business model for this technology. Thus, the purpose of this research is to propose a conceptual business model for SMS-based government services, based on the Configuration Theory."

Data integration presents core issues like interoperability, technical heterogeneity and flexibility. Census Web Service is an open standard based Web application that interacts with other web applications for the purpose of sharing citizen data. This will help in using uniform and consistent census data across various e-Governance applications. This paper presents a census data integration mechanism based on the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) with various e-Governance applications. The proposed architecture consists of three layers; Web Service Provider, Service Broker and Web Service Consumers. Web Service providers publish services to a service broker. Web Service Consumers find required services using a service broker and bind to them. These layers are implemented based on a set of standards including EXtensible Markup Language (XML), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Web Services Description Language (WSDL) and Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) to deal with technical heterogeneity. A prototype of the framework is implemented and validated with e-Governance applications for issuing Caste Certificate and Rural Area Certificate. It is concluded that census web service can be effective and efficient in all types of e-Governance applications as it can provide accurate and timely information within reasonable amount of time."

E-Government brings a radical change in business process, organizational culture, and human behavior and change is resisted by human nature unless proper awareness about it is created among the stakeholders and enforced through administrative measures. Therefore, we are focused on the successful implementation of G2G e-Government programs in Pakistan. This paper presents a four layered holistic framework for the successful implementation of e-Government programs in G2G sector of e-Government in Pakistan. The target audience of the survey is limited to local IT industry professionals, government employees, bureaucrats, and members of the parliament. Sample size for survey is limited to 250. We need to put the things in their right perspective. Top level political leadership must own the e-Government initiatives to make them successful. The proposed framework encompasses all the prerequisites which play a pivotal role in the success of e-Government. As it is based on the collective wisdom of the key stakeholders in G2G sector of e-Government, it can be very useful for the successful implementation of e-Government programs if implemented in its true spirit."

They are developed to assist voters by enhancing the basis on which they decide how to vote. Typical VAA's do this by matching users' policy-preferences with the positions of parties and/or candidates. Nowadays, VAA's are able to attract huge numbers of respondents and to provide a significantly rich source of mass public opinion data. However, not all parties or candidates provide their positions regarding the statements revealed in the VAA platform in order to derive recommendations for users. The majority of candidate profiles are constructed using expert analysis, extracting the position of parties and/or candidates from different data sources, such as interviews, speeches, and discussions, among others. This type of profile generation is time-consuming and sometimes arguable, which may lead to mismatching or biased results. Therefore, it is important to find a dynamic approach for building candidate profiles. In this paper, the authors propose a so-called VAA 2.0, which generates dynamic profiles of politicians by extracting their attitude toward policy-issue statements from their official Twitter accounts. The VAA 2.0 works with the Twitter API, a directional model for matching algorithm, an affective norm for English words (ANEW) library, the cumulative distribution function, and the probability density function for sentiment analysis."

Although the cooperation between them is the best outcome, they usually compete for popularity and efficiency, representing conflicting views on engagement. In this paper, we aim to determine factors influencing the outcome of such competition. We analyze the sources of portals' viability as separate initiatives and the possibilities for their convergence and cooperation. We take the case of St. Petersburg (Russia), where public authorities and civic activists have created two e-participation platforms to address the same issues of urban development. Our main argument is that the viability of portals is based on their institutional basis. Our findings suggest that while the government -- sponsored initiative is a formal institutional innovation with strong political support, it is unlikely to sustain changes in the bureaucratic process without political leadership. The civic initiative does not create new laws, but develops online community, contributing to new social norms. When the former is winning the competition in the short-term, the latter has a strategic advantage. Co-existence and ""forced cooperation"" is the most possible future here, as the institutional environment forces the government and activists to cooperate despite the escalating conflict. A rational choice by citizens, whose alternative suits their interests best, will also determine the future of the portals, but is shaped by the abovementioned conditions."

This paper investigates the perceived barriers to e-Participation and affordances of Social Media from the perspectives of senior decision maker and political actors. Grounded in the analytical framework for the duality e-Participation, we designed an instrument and interviewed 10 politicians and decision makers at different levels of government across three countries in Europe. Our results provide insights into barriers and perceived affordances of Social Media for e-Participation as well as the necessary conditions for increased adoption of Social Media for citizen-led participation."

However, despite this great potential, mobile phones have not yet gained much acceptance as e-voting tools in developing countries due to poor user experience (UX). User experience is a person's perceptions and responses that result from the use and/or anticipated use of a product, system or service. User experience has been under extensive study over the last decade, generating a number of user experience design and evaluation models and frameworks. Nevertheless, existing UX models and frameworks provide very little on how positive perceptions and responses that result from the anticipated use of a product (AUX) can be attained. One of the few frameworks that cover AUX was developed by Yogasara, called the ""characteristics of anticipated user experience"". Although the framework gives basic hints on what designers should be looking out for in the early stages of systems development, the framework is generic and of a high-level nature, without an illustration or explanation about how it can be used in the development of an ICT-enabled product/service with positive AUX. In this paper, we extend Yogasara's framework and show how the characteristics that engender positive user experience in Yogasara's framework can be realized in mobile voting systems to influences acceptance and usage of mobile phones for voting in a developing country like Uganda."

The database search through Scopus resulted in 115 articles, which formed the basis of this literature review. The keywords analysis of these articles indicates that 'e-government' and 'social media' were the most explored keywords across these studies. The methodological analysis indicates that the majority of the studies were analytical/conceptual/descriptive/theoretical in nature. The theoretical analysis, however, indicates that there is a lack of such research that has used some well-established theories or models to understand this concept. The review of literature further indicates that research themes such as 'electronic participation', 'engagement', 'transparency', 'communication/ interaction', 'trust' and 'collaboration' were found as some of the most frequently used categories under this area of research."

The present study intends to explore the factors involved in e-participation as well as the expanse of e-governance in India. By drawing out variables from extant literature, the study proceeds toward identifying people's participation in e-governance, the circumstances that bolster such participation, factors responsible for reduced involvement, and steps that may be initiated for enhanced involvement and engagement in future. It is understood that people's participation in electronic democracy is contingent upon several factors such as privacy, technical support, accessibility, integrity, open access to every stakeholder, clarity in agenda of discussion, perceived risk of identity, as well as awareness and popularity of electronic media. In a nutshell, the study contributes towards building a bond between the trio -technology, governance and individuals."

The existing policy framework of the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) also emphasizes good governance. The Government in association with various national and international partners is wholeheartedly working to achieve its commitments in the Constitution, legal and policy framework. However, the criminal justice system in Bangladesh is still facing challenges. Courts have millions of cases backlogged and prisons are over 200% capacity. Approximately 70% of prisoners have not been convicted and many are poor, vulnerable, and lacking legal representation or knowledge. Reports over the last decade have pointed to a wide range of shortcomings. Whilst good efforts have been made in institutions, the interdependencies within the system call for a more holistic reform strategy. A consensus view is that 'Doing Nothing is not an Option'. Before embarking on a process of reform, the GoB determined to establish what is happening in the system, where the gaps are and blockages to delivery of these services. It commissioned a Justice Audit of the criminal justice system in five districts. This Experience paper sets out how Government, through the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, and with the support of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and the Department for International Development (DFID), went about this Justice Audit, what it found and what it did with the findings."

Implementation of intentionally agreed commitments like Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Sustainable development Goals (SDGs) are influencing data production and availability, and the development of national statistical capacities. They also trigger challenges and opportunities in production of internationally comparable data to induce fair comparability among nations. Being a signatory to major international treaties, India has considerably improved data production, accessibility and availability over the years to ensure proper alignment of national level statistics and induce international comparison. However, very little efforts have been made to assess India's progress around data production and dissemination around growingly important land governance. This assessment attempts to identify key opportunities and challenges at the country level to improve data availability, access, timeliness and quality. India has made many progressive reforms around land laws and institutions to make land governance more inclusive and equitable; however its assessment with respect to global best practices through World Bank's Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF) indicate the need of improvements around different land dimensions. Movement towards good land governance outcomes is incumbent upon robust and regular monitoring mechanism of land indicators across spatial (viz. administrative boundaries, land being a state subject in India) and temporal scales. India has traditions of collecting, maintaining and reporting land information through nation-wide surveys, census, administrative and judicial reports/ databases. Its flagship program Digital India Land Record Modernization Program (DILRMP), has been supporting universal digitization of spatial and textual land records by the states. Together, these administrative and survey-derived datasets provide seamless opportunity for routine generation of data on key land indicators at low cost on a regular basis. Land is a state subject in India. Monitoring and reporting land-indicators at state levels would help in systematically discovering and identifying good practice that can then be documented and disseminated across states, manage change, and gradually move towards a more performance-based approach to improving land governance in India. However, there have been lack of institutionalized attempts, so far, to report land-indicators at national scale. We have tried to assess the state of data in India, particularly to track and report two critical land governance indicators viz. women land rights and forest rights, critical to ensure equity and sustainability in terms of public policy. With UN's SDG, defining similar indicators, we also attempt aligning them around SDG indicators. Status of these two parameters were analyzed using nation-wide datasets collecting whole population data, through legitimate institutions following robust processes and reporting them open access. Census (human population) data and Forest Survey of India (FSI) data were used to assess village-wise forest areas eligible for recognition of rights under India's historic Forest Rights Act, 2005. Using the FSI data and meta-analysis of census data, we calculated the estimated population (150 million including 90 million tribal) living in villages that have forest land within administrative revenue boundaries, potential area (40 million ha) that can be recognized under FRA and number of villages (0.17 million) that are eligible to initiate the claim. These data were made available across administrative boundaries of state, district and village, providing opportunities for relevant Government Ministries at Central and State level and civil society to expedite the forest rights recognition under India's largest land reform process. In order to assess women's land rights (WLR) in India in the context of the SDGs, after examining the existing data sets, we used Agricultural Census data, conducted by Government of India every fifth year following the guidelines of World Census on Agriculture (WCA). Using Agricultural census data, we have developed atlas of women land rights (based on operational holdings) in India with state and district wise granularity with further disaggregation across ethnicity (caste) and other socio-economic parameters. The study also attempted to analyze the link between the inter-regional and temporal variability of WLR and relevant policies and legal-institutional frameworks among the states to see if the correlations can better inform public policy and also induce healthy competition among states to appreciate and follow best practices. This paper presents the process, methodology and results of the data-analysis for these two land indicators while delving into the scope and challenges of dealing with existing and upcoming big datasets in India to report the land governance indicators and the potential policy spinoffs."

However, it is not clear to what extent ICT initiatives are truly empowering citizens and government managers. In order to understand how ICT initiatives have been empowering citizens, we propose a conceptual framework and some preliminary findings. Based on a systematic review of recent literature, the framework should be useful for assessing the levels of empowerment produced or facilitated by different ICT initiatives. As an ongoing research, we also share some preliminary findings from selected ICT initiatives across India."

Over the last decade, India has witnessed a multifold increase in government initiatives to digitally connect India from within and with outside world in order to promote economic growth and wellbeing in the country. This advancement in ICT has created an explosive growth in digital data with almost every industry and business area digitizing their data ushering in the dawn of an era of big data in India. Financial frauds have emerged as an undesirable and inescapable byproduct of this economic growth with numerous chit fund and MLM companies coming under the scanner of government agencies such as SFIO, SEBI and ED for fraudulent activities. To combat the growing menace of fraud with clinching evidences present in the form of digital data, it has become imperative to develop tools and technologies to understand the massive amounts of digital data being collected by government agencies. The paper focuses on various tools and technologies which are currently being used for fraud analysis. Further, it presents a fund flow algorithm that could be used to detect dubious fund transactions using bank transaction statements by analyzing the fund flow between various entities. It takes as input the bank transaction data of various parties of interest and generates as output a directed graph with nodes depicting the source and destination of fund transfer and directed arrows showing the direction of fund flow. Further, this paper focuses on the role of data analytics in understanding the massive volumes of digital data being collected by government enforcement agencies in combating financial frauds in India. The paper discusses the concerns and challenges based on complexities in data capturing, storage, analysis and visualization along with possible future directions."

Open content creation projects are a kind of peer production that involves contributors editing and sharing 'content'. Motivation plays a major role in the content contributions since they are voluntary in nature. Motivations driving the contributors could be pro-social or personal-needs oriented. I propose to evaluate the motivations behind such contributions across countries, using a national cultural perspective. The propositions suggest, each of cultural dimensions [14] will have influences on the contributory behaviors differently. This has major implications in ICT4D since the cultural perspective shows different motivations that could drive contributors in the developing economies, leading to socioeconomic development."

ICTs workplace harassment requires the use of ICT and is verbal, sexual, emotional or social abuse of a person, group or organization. There is very limited existing research in this area. A literature review of research pertaining to workplace harassment using ICTs was completed. Findings indicate that workplace harassment through ICTs is becoming more prevalent as employees spend more time using technology that keep them connected to people during and after working hours. There are many different ways in which workplace harassment through ICTs reach their victims, and includes instant messaging over the Internet, social networking web sites, text messaging and phone calls to cell phones. ICTs harassment is a serious problem which can cause the victim to feel inadequate and overly self-conscious, along with the possibility of committing suicide due to harassment.

Current business literature is replete with fragmented conceptualizations, which only partially describe aspects of a business model. In addition, the existing conceptualizations do not explicitly support the emerging phenomenon of open government data -- an increasingly valuable economic and strategic resource. Consequently, no comprehensive, formal, executable open government data business model ontology exists, that could be directly leveraged to facilitate the design, development of an operational open data business model. This paper bridges this gap by providing a parsimonious yet sufficiently detailed, conceptualization and formal ontology of open government data business model for open data-driven organizations. Following the design science approach, we developed the ontology as a 'design artefact' and validate the ontology by using it to describe an open data business model of an open data-driven organization."

With the emergence of ICTs, citizens' participation processes took new forms such as social media, blogs and participative platforms. Nevertheless, although citizens' participation outstands a great value for governments, its implementation raises several issues. Based on a review of the literature, this paper identifies a typology of issues regarding the implementation of CP processes. This paper is an attempt to open new research avenues on citizens' participation through the multidisciplinary typology of issues it proposes. As well, drawing on two categories of issues (citizens' and technology issues), a context-based citizen participation approach is proposed that is based on three main concepts: context-based reasoning, spatio-temporal representation, and visual analytics. Further empirical studies need to be established to assert the relevance of the proposed approach."

As quality data is not easily accessible, there is a general need to facilitate sharing and utilization of the large amount of data generated by Ministries/Departments/Organizations/ States of India in an open format exposing them for further value addition to enable effective governance and enhanced public service delivery. Over the last decade or so the idea of open data in correlation with the idea of open government data has gained a lot of prominence and limelight, courtesy the continuous effort of the citizen groups demanding a more transparent and accountable governance. Recognizing the importance of availability of open data to its citizen for increased levels of transparency and accountability and to promote higher level of public participation the Government of India under the aegis of National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) initiated Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India to share government data with its citizens. This has built a foundation to create an open data ecosystem in the country. NDSAP was gazette notified on 17th March 2012 mandating the government entities to proactively release their datasets in Open Format. According to the preamble of NDSAP, there has been an increasing demand by the community that data collected with the deployment of public funds should be made more readily available to all, for enabling rational debate, better decision making and use in meeting civil society needs. Implementation of NDSAP through OGD Platform since its Alpha release in 2012 has been increasing the usability and relevance of open government data and sustaining the ecosystem around it. In this paper we are trying to analyze the policy implementation strategy and how that has created a sustainable open government data ecosystem in various sectors."

An important type of such studies is the so-called ex-post evaluation. The main objective of ex-post evaluations is to determine to what extent a realized intervention is successful in tackling a societal challenge, e.g., youth unemployment. At a first glance an obvious method is to collect some baseline measurements for a set of relevant variables, apply the intervention for a while and collect the new measurement values for the same set of variables. Then, comparing the measurement values of the variables before and after the intervention provides an insight into the extent of successfulness of the intervention. This, however, is only true if the ""ceteris paribus"" condition holds. In practice it is infeasible to enforce this condition for societal challenges. Often, after having the baseline measurements, several phenomena emerge that may impact the new measurements without being taken into account. This makes it difficult to determine how much of the measured differences between the values of the variables before and after the intervention should be attributed to the emerging phenomena (or the so-called counterfactuals) and how much of the differences can be attributed to the applied intervention. This paper discusses how exploiting big data may contribute to the task of elucidating the influences of counterfactuals (and interventions) in ex-post evaluation studies. The paper proposes a framework to utilize big data for accounting for the impact of emerging phenomena in ex-post evaluation studies."

In order to find this out, we explored the communication between ten public organizations and the citizens in Rwanda. We discovered about 20 communication channels; 12 of them could benefit from various applications of language technology. Furthermore, we explored the potential of language technology for analysis of digital communication in order to better understand the citizens' needs and opinions and, hereby, increase the level of e-participation, participatory decision and policy making."

However, there are a number of factors that need to be considered for these tools to become really effective to promote citizenship. This paper describes research conducted to identify the limits and possibilities of the use of these apps for citizenship in Brazil. For this study, 98 apps available to Brazilian citizens were analyzed in relation to technical and qualitative aspects. It also analyzed the institutional environment and policies related to the theme. The results showed that these apps have been used in Brazil as an additional way of providing information, but are under used in promoting citizenship through public service provision or citizen participation."

By their very nature, young people lack the necessary collateral that financial institutions require in order to grant credit. This situation calls for innovative ways to raise the necessary capital for any business venture. A developing country like South Africa, with a high unemployment rate, young people are pressed to explore alternative ways to create their own jobs. Stokvels are known to provide credit with less strict conditions compared to mainstream banks. WhatsApp has significantly altered the stokvel landscape. Young people have discovered alternative means of accessing soft credit to enhance their own economic power. This new trend offers an exciting field of investigation for development practitioners, researchers and policy makers. This research project explored mobile phone practices amongst 'young entrepreneurs from townships' in the informal business sector in Durban, South Africa. It relied on in-depth interviews with selected young entrepreneurs in order to understand better this emerging trend of accessing credit via WhatsApp. From this research, the study found out that young people preferred WhatsApp-operated Stokvels because they were easily accessible, the money needed was available on the same day within hours of request and no strings attached to the lending because lending was done on the basis of mutual trust and commitment to the stokvel. From this study, it is evident that mobile technology is a catalyst for youth entrepreneurship. Mobile platforms such as WhatsApp are instrumental in enabling financing of young entrepreneurs to realize their dreams whilst at the sametime addressing the chronic challenge of youth unemployment in the country."

The era of a government in isolation that has all the answers is ending. More and more co-production, collaboration and peer production concepts are emerging on public management conversations. But there is very little evidence of these joint projects using technology. Open innovation in governments is a recent research field in Mexico. This paper reports the case of the use of open innovation in Mexico City's transportation system, named Mapaton (large map), using gamification to engage citizens in order to map transportation routes using a smartphone App. With the model Open Innovation Process Phases proposed by Mergel, we interviewed six persons --public officials, citizens, academics -- from the Mapaton coordinator team. We found that an innovation process is an iterative work and requires a preliminary stage of building trust between governments and citizens. Also the result of this research argues that this combined effort will change."

Continuous developments in mobile technology have led to massive acquisition and adoption of mobile devices at a fast pace. The penetration of mobile use is higher in developing countries than that in developed countries. The emerging developments as well as rapid adaptability of mobile technologies have raised research interests in the field of mobile government. In this paper, we analyze the potential of e-Governance and web services in m-Governance citing the exemplary work of project Telecom Commercial Communication Customer Preference (TCCCP). M-Governance is envisaged to propel the functioning of the government, at the next higher level. Mobile phones have become an important component in Indian household. But the telemarketing calls are a major cause of worry not only for people in India, but across the globe. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is proactively and constantly working towards curbing of Unsolicited Commercial Communications (UCC) which also grew along with the telecom Industry. The Authority also faces various set of concerns like making consumers choose their preference of UCC messages they wish to receive, either to block them or partially allow them, escalation of complaints, resolution of complaint with in stipulated time frame, communication to customer regarding their complain status and to monitor all the Service Providers. This paper gives an overview of NCPR (National Customer Preference Register) implementation, which aims to develop a collaborative and unified service platform to ensure seamless integration of various stakeholders, the consumers, the Tele Marketer (TM), The Service Provider (SP) as a major step towards a transparent, accountable and 24x7 service platform. This paper also emphasizes the role of Do Not Disturb (DND) Services app and how web services were used for the same. This is a unique initiative step in the country. Only few countries in the world have implemented such solutions to curb UCC and handle them with respect to consumer preference."

Our literature review on past ICT projects underscores the challenge of low adoption especially in emerging market such as India. This situation could be attributed to mismatch between information offered versus actually required by the users, information representation, projects with tech-driven approach rather user driven, and overlooking users literacy level. In the context of ICT4D, users are supposed to be the central beneficiary, and they could be involved early-on in the development and testing phases. The proposed design approach advocates integration of Rogers's diffusion theory and user centered design cycle to develop product brief and technological development of the ICT projects. We link Rogers's innovation attributes to the design process of ICT products and services."

This has not only reduced the digital divide but has become instrumental in realizing m-Governance to a large extent as more and more people have access to cell phones at an affordable cost. In keeping with the ""Digital India"" campaign to empower the citizens by ensuring that government services are made available through online infrastructure and Internet connectivity, a plethora of digital services are being delivered through government portals. But, this can have a real impact when common people can access government portals easily, irrespective of their age, culture, disabilities, literacy level etc. The accessibility of web portals largely depends on the design of portals as well as the web-browsers being used for the purpose. In this paper, we have critically analyzed the accessibility features of fifteen commonly used web browsers for android mobile phones with respect to the UAAG 2.0 international standards. The findings thereof, can guide the designers to improve upon the design of cell phone browsers by taking care of the deficiencies. The overall objective is to develop user-friendly web browsers for cell phones enabling diverse user groups to access a wide range of m-Governance services with ease."

In Indian culture, women have always taken the back seat in family decision making. Their life revolves around the family and fulfilling its needs. Today, the condition of women has improved as compared to yester-years but, due to lack of awareness, they still use very limited resources to empower themselves. The sample for this study has been taken from the economic capital of India, Mumbai, where Information & Communication Technology (ICT) and digitization are easily accessible. Despite the easy accessibility of ICT and digitization, this paper suggests that women in this city appear to have a limited purpose in using the internet or ICT. ICT and digitization are largely used for online social interaction and entertainment. This study finds that women are dependent on their family before and after marriage, for financial decision making. Online education does not depend on age and employment status, but on educational qualification and marital status. Thus, the study suggests that social and economic inequality exists and that they hinder capacity-building among women. With the help of this study, one gains an understanding of the purposes for which women use available digital facilities. The findings suggest that governments need to design and implement more interactive awareness programmes and policies for women to empower them through the effective and efficient use of the digital platform."

While initial initiatives had very ambitious goals and often struggled implementing them, later projects were more limited in scale and scope. It became clear that understanding how existing MWNs are used is crucial in order to develop networks that satisfy expectations and needs of local residents and visitors. This will help building networks that are useful for the population at large and thus actively used. This study contributes to a better understanding of how MWNs are used and who their users are: to do so it analyses both network and user-provided data of the ""WiFi Lugano"" network, a MWN of a medium-sized Swiss city. With the help of cluster analysis, it identifies five different usage practices: two business-oriented ones -- ""E-mailer"" and ""Mobile-worker"", two tourism-oriented ones --""Tourism information seeker"" and ""Always-on traveler"", and one reflecting the practices of locals -- ""Local social networker""."

The Digital India programme run by Government of India is taken as a case study by the authors. Rather than depending on traditional methodologies to bring gender equality, can we consider Digital India as a potential solution? This paper explores the answer to the above question from a gendered perspective with the help of primary data analysis of a few selected Digital India products and services."

For PwDs to use ICTs and ICT enabled services, they need appropriate Assistive Technologies. Therefore, mainstream ICTs and ICT enabled services must be adapted to work with assistive technologies. The adapted ICTs are commonly called inclusive ICTs. In Uganda, the status of provision and support for use of inclusive ICTs in general and in the education of PwDs in particular, is not known. A few studies have reported low level accessibility of ICT and ICT enabled services for PwDs but at a general level. Therefore, more effort is needed not only to report the status but also to address the gaps. Relevant policies such as the 2011 Draft1 Special Needs and Inclusive Education policy, the Uganda National ICT policy, the Rural Communication Development Fund (RCDF) and the Government of Uganda Website Standards are all silent about making ICTs accessible in general and in the education for PwDs in particular. This paper reports results of an audit of inclusive ICTs for education of PwDs in Uganda. The study was an implementation of the first phase of the UNESCO policy on inclusive ICTs in education for PwDs in Uganda. The aim of the study was to audit current actions in Uganda on use of inclusive ICTs in education for PwDs and provide recommendations on actions needed to increase use of inclusive ICTs for education of PwDs. Due to time, and resource constraints, and the interest of the sponsor, the scope of disabilities covered in the study was limited to visual and hearing impairments."

Therefore, a system that enables the doctors to get an integrated view of the patient information on an anytime/anywhere basis, over mobile devices would be of immense value. This paper describes an acute care system that can be set up and made fully operational within a few hours, at a fraction of the cost of competing solutions. This system is designed considering the specific needs of developing countries which include -- intermittent internet connection at operational locations, and limited information technology knowledge among supporting staff. This makes it ideal in providing support for medical requirements in remote areas, disaster sites, conflict zones, etc. It is also useful for home health care and in the intensive care units, operation theatres and emergency wards of hospitals."

According to the recent reports of World Health Organization (WHO), in 2015, Delhi, India, recorded its worst outbreak since 2006 with over 15000 Dengue Fever (DF) cases. According to WHO (Global Environmental Change, Geneva) report there is a strong indication of inter-annual variability and connection between meteorological factors and infectious diseases such as DF and many other vector-borne diseases. Therefore, integration of surrounding important causative factors of vector-borne diseases such as DF along with Geographic Information System (GIS) and statistical methods will further improve the efficiency of identification and prediction of disease outbreaks. The present work is aimed to demonstrate use of Digital Geo-spatial technologies to identify potential hot spots of DF incidences so that proactive actions can be taken to control its spread. Space-time clustering for DF incidences using Kulldorff's space-time scan statistic method has been performed to determine the clusters of DF outbreaks geographically. Also, high risk areas are identified spatially with the help of Getis-Ord Gi* statistic implemented in GIS. Furthermore, acquired data was then analyzed for correlation with meteorological parameters such as wind speed, humidity and demographic factors such as age and gender. The statistically significant space and space-time clusters of DF have been identified, thus showing that their occurrence is not random. The results revealed that there is a significant relationship between meteorological parameters and DF incidences. Study is helpful for the health authorities of Delhi to take proactive actions in identified DF clusters to contain its spread and risk."

A team of researchers worked closely with prospective users and various other relevant stakeholders as a part of an ongoing action research project involving health facilities in Kolar district of the southern Indian state of Karnataka over a ten month period. These interactions with health workers and medical professionals responsible for administering the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases & Stroke (NPCDCS) provided useful insights in designing and developing an automated reporting system for use initially in a community health centre (CHC). An ongoing and continuous involvement is helping in enlisting a high degree of participation thereby allowing co-creation of more improved variants of the ICT-based reporting system."

The rapid growth in use of computers, electronic devices and gadgets in today's urbanized world, leads to more production, consumption and generation of Waste Electrical or Electronic equipment (WEEE) or E-Waste. E-Waste is a hazardous waste, thus there is a challenge to manage it and its proper disposal. The authorized E-waste recycling facilities in India capture only 3% of total E-waste generated; the rest makes its way to informal recycling yards in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. Ahmedabad is selected among the first 20 Smart Cities in India under the Smart Cities Mission, Ministry of Urban development (MOUD), Government of India (GOI). Ahmedabad also ranks sixth among the top ten Indian cities generating E-waste. The paper describes a study of the existing scenario of e-waste management; the level of awareness in the people for the disposal of e-waste by surveying the formal and informal sector, consumers/end-users, small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) in the city of Ahmedabad."

Indian government is also moving towards e-governance, via use of ICT. But, India is a country with huge diversity. As per Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011, rural India accounted 73 percent of households. People living in these household are having poor literacy rate and not much aware of government's initiatives for upliftment of their lives. These people are engaged in cultivation, casual or manual labour. Lack of awareness, access to ICT and shabby Digital Literacy is preventing them from availing various government schemes and creating the problem of Digital Divide. We carried out a survey to study these reality checks at the ground level and suggested a solution model for bridging the gap of Digital Divide in rural India."

It has been showing significant result in addressing information asymmetry gap in many sectors and localities, especially in agriculture & allied sector. The rural people, specifically farming communities have been getting timely & relevant information, services & support, and farming inputs. However, the sustainability of these ICT based efforts in improving well-being of farming communities is key to the effectiveness of a rural ICT projects in India. The present paper aimed to determine the sustainability of the aAQUA (Almost All Questions Answered) e-Agriservice in Maharashtra state, western parts of India covering the four districts of the state. The study used the ex-post facto (cause to effect) research design in a quasi-intervention setting. The list of registered users was obtained from the service provider (presently Agrocom Software Technologies Pvt. Ltd.) and total of 120 users were selected randomly from four districts (30 users from each district). The sustainable-Agriservice Index (SeAGRSI) was computed based on the five dimensions viz. technological, economic, social, institutional, and political by using Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA), Mixed Method Approach and Normalized Rank Order Method (NROM). The study revealed that the SeAGRSI for the social indicators was the highest among other dimensions of the sustainability (SeAGRSI = 0.77) followed by the technologically (0.73), economic (0.71) political (0.62) and institutional (0.58) sustainable. It was also found that the mean SeAGRSI was 0.70 as reported by one third (32.50%) of the users, which means 70 per cent the aAQUA e-Agriservice was technologically, socially, economically, institutionally and politically sustainable."

By fact, most digital services are local and by large, most of them are developed in isolation from the neighbouring local governments, either national or international. In the digital area, this is a huge challenge, as independently developed digital services tend to be locked-in to specific standards making future cross-border services challenging. We propose a model for joint digital services in the cross-border cities -- the Urban Operating System. The model will be validated in two Northern European cities with high commuting frequency: Helsinki and Tallinn."

These processes occur at faster pace than regulatory bodies can manage and the use of geo-spatial techniques has become a must if we want to have any chance for a rational planning process. In this paper, a part of a broader question ""can a 3D city model and its visualization support urban planners in obtaining a greater understanding of a given urban problem and enhance decision making?"" is explored. A 3D information rich model (3DIRM) of case area (Kannadasan Nagar, Chennai) is generated using ArcGIS and ArcScene with the following information such as, land-use, road width, permissible floor space index (FSI), height of the building, setbacks, building use etc. Classification of 3DIRM based on local zoning regulation was carried out to check with the compliance of development codes. By strictly following code compliance, the buildings in case area can be classified into three types, ordinary buildings (OB-77%), special buildings (SB-20%) and multi-storied buildings (MSB-3%), whereas as the actual development observed is OB-75%, SB-4% and MSB-21%, more than 20,000 sq.m of built-up area is added under MSB typology which has gone unnoticed by the development authority. Results suggest that having an advanced geo-spatial tool such as 3D GIS can help urban planner in enhancing the decision making processes and the implementation of zoning regulations."

Yet some cities have been more successful than others in becoming a smart city. This raises the questions why were some cities able to become smart, whereas other were not able to do so? This research is aimed at identifying factors influencing the shift towards becoming a smart city. In this way insight is gained into factors that governments can influence to become a smart city. First, Literature was reviewed to identify dimensions and factors enabling or impeding the process of becoming a smart city. These factors were used to compare two similar type of case studies. The cases took different paths to become a smart city and had different levels of success. This enabled us to identify factors influencing the move towards smart cities. The results reveal that existing infrastructures should be used and extended in such a way that they can facilitate a variety of different applications. Synergy from legacy systems can avoid extra expenditures. Having such an infrastructure in place facilitates the development of new organizational models. These models are developed outside the existing organization structure to avoid hinder from existing practices and organizational structures. This finding suggests that smart cities focussed on structural ambidexterity innovate quicker."

This can be used to compare the states against each other so as to evaluate their status as per the national & international standards. The study is exploratory in nature as it develops arguments over an Index based on combination of theory, past literature and international reports w.r.t. E-Governance services and associated available infrastructure. It considers research papers from 2000-2015 and major reports on E-Governance after 2006. The need to develop an index based on different parameters is identified. The major areas to be covered up in the development index are online availability and performance of E-Governance service, telecommunication infrastructure, human capital, infrastructure availability and electronic participation by the citizens. Other areas are security and ease of access of the services. Development Index formulation will suggest that the development status for various Indian states, w.r.t. E-Governance, is based on lot of factors like the geographical location, demographic distribution, quality of human resources, and infrastructure present. A state merely having large number of E-Governance services does not become an automatic choice of best state for E-Governance development in the country. The state should be able to justify the overall development rather than being beneficial to just a small section of its population. Indian national E-Governance plan needs to assess the weak zones of the country so as to take initiatives to upgrade them and bid for overall higher ranking in the E-Governance Development Index of United Nations. There is no overall quantitative assessment framework available for E-Governance development in India as of now. So this research is novel with respect to E-Governance development and its assessment."

This paper aims to (1) identify challenges of m-government in developed and developing countries and (2) investigate approaches used for designing m-government applications. The challenges are categorised based on the factors of PESTELMO and are further examined to identify requirements for suitable m-government design. Design approaches are analysed by the Content, Context and Process (CCP) framework and are examined to identify requirements, methods and guidelines addressed. The paper finally outlines research needs for a comprehensive design framework for m-government solutions and presents initial requirements for the framework."

However, countries across the world are divided over the choice of Internet governance structure, i.e. multi-stakeholder versus multilateral form. This paper explores the role of institutional quality of countries on this choice. We base our empirical analysis on the WCIT-2012 data (of 144 countries) using the theory of legitimacy of governance forms. The analysis supports our hypothesized relationship. Further, a qualitative study of the ICT policies of 25 countries reveals the role of Internet affordances in this relationship. It also reveals how major national and international events can change the perceived affordances of Internet for countries which may have an effect on their preference for a particular governance structure."

This paper presents an ontology framework that describes the formal and explicit specification of the concepts of regulatory requirements compliance and their relations in e-Government system development. The ontology engineering technique 101 and Systematic Literature Review (SLR) were used in the process of developing the ontology framework of e-Government regulatory requirements compliance (eGovRRC). The e-Government system analyst can use this framework as a reference model to understand and conceptualize the interlinked set of clearly defined concepts of regulatory requirements compliance in e-Government system development projects."

This paper attempts to study this both at a macro level by using inter country data and at the micro level by analysing two schemes by the Government of India. The picture that emerged at the macro level might be very different from what is happening at the micro level where the schemes are actually implemented and citizens / businesses seek services and transact with the government through e-channels. The findings of this study would enable us understand and navigate the complexity associated with deployment of ICT in government and should aim to create a 'New Normal' in government functioning, wherein, public services are provided by government agencies in an efficient and effective manner. The results of this study matter more as the government is in the process of implementing initiatives like Digital India, Skill India and Smart Cities. To calculate governance index parameter, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on world development indicators of governance of Control of Corruption: Estimate, Government Effectiveness: Estimate, Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism: Estimate, Regulatory Quality: Estimate, Rule of Law: Estimate, Voice and Accountability: Estimate. To gauge the digital preparedness of a country, instead of using the standard e-Governance index released by United Nations (UN), we have performed principal component analysis on the sub-indices released by UN that is e-Participation index, Online services index, Telecommunications index to prepare the modified e-Governance index. However, HDI and GNI (per capita) were used as standard indicators of socio-economic and economic development. The second part to the study will try to compare two digitisation schemes implemented in India and analyse the relative success achieved by both. This study is largely based on the exploratory survey, secondary research and collective experience of the organizations involved in the study. As part of the exploratory survey, views, inputs and feedback from several stakeholders in the e-Government community in India will be gathered and compiled. Drawing from these inputs received and a large body of secondary source of knowledge, the paper will broadly summarizes the current issues and challenges in the context of Project Management in two Flagship digitisation schemes in India and the suggested strategic shift required in the approach to make the schemes more viable."

In addition to the improvement of ICT infrastructure, governments across the world now pay more attention to the creation of public values though ICT policies. Due to the promising nature of e-governance, it appears that identifying the factors that would help facilitate public value of information technology is extremely important. This research proposes a public value of e-governance framework with three major public values: operational, political and social values, for the development of public value and electronic governance research and national comparison. The framework requires multi-year survey data to ensure its comprehensiveness, feasibility and the continuous updating of subjective indicator data. With three years survey, we find out that the continued enhancement of e-government programs coupled with the elevation of administrative management efficiency and flexibility could lessen the time needed for policy creation and implementation. In addition, Internet might trigger e-participation, therefore government should continue to strive toward open government (including information and data disclosure) and pushing for all kinds of online citizen engagement mechanisms."

This dataification shows the paramount need to identify the means and methods in which the value of data and knowledge can be exploited. While not restricted to the government domain, this dataification is certainly relevant in a government context, particularly due to the large volume of data generated by public institutions. In this paper we identify the various activities and roles within a data value chain, and hence proceed to provide our own definition of a Data Value Network. We specifically cater for non-tangible data products and characterise three dimensions that play a vital role within the Data Value Network. We also propose a Demand and Supply Distribution Model with the aim of providing insight on how an entity can participate in the global data market by producing a data product, as well as a concrete implementation through the Demand and Supply as a Service. Through our contributions we therefore project our vision of enhancing the process of open (government) data exploitation and innovation, with the aim of achieving the highest possible impact."

Based on systems thinking modeling, we propose a new model to understand the dynamics and the continuous change of e-Government structures. Whether this change is endogenous or exogenous, the need for transformative strategies and better e-Government models is indispensable. The proposed model emphasizes that e-Government is not linear and changes over time and provides a methodology to find an answer to the difficult question ""How does e-Government Work?"

However, several surveys are reporting that ICT has a positive impact on government by automating the processes and reducing the cost and increasing time efficiency, etc., they are limited in case studies. While many studies have provided valuable facts about the role of ICT in government, there remains a strong need for studies with quantitative methods that can help to determine ICT's position toward government effectiveness, which, according to World Bank captures the perception of the quality of public and civil services, the quality of policy formulation and implementation. This study attempts to explore and analyze the effect of ICT development on government effectiveness by engaging four statistical tests: Fisher-exact test, Chi-squared test, Likelihood test and F-test in on ICT data provided by the International Telecommunication Unit and government effectiveness data provided by World Bank."

This study aims to use secondary data on the Health Management Information Systems project in India, as a single case study to highlight the processes, structures and mechanisms used to effect IT governance in an e-government context while also using the same to highlight potential gaps between the intended governance policy and implementation. Through this, the study aims to highlight the need for more conscious attempts at anticipating and resolving information technology governance challenges in the e-government context."

CDA represents the collaborative processes of various actors with different expertise and affiliations to jointly analyze data using advanced information technologies and sophisticated techniques. The purpose of this paper is to propose a preliminary framework to examine the factors and challenges pertinent to CDA in emergency situations. The framework proposed in this paper classifies the challenges and determinants of CDA into four broad categories: (1) skills-related, (2) organizational, (3) political, and (4) technological. The four components influence how CDA works and influence how each expert interacts with one another to analyze data, make collective decisions, and synthesize crisis learning. In turn, the lessons identified from crisis learning will be used to refine the data analysis process in the CDA effort. In addition, the processes and outcomes of CDA, as well as the resulting crisis learning, are affected by the type of crisis at hand."

This paper presents experiences from this electoral team that utilized WhatsApp as a tool for relaying information amongst themselves and the control centre in reporting incidences as they occurred in various parts of the province. The main findings emanating from this project were that monitors found it easier to communicate with another while in the field and could secure critical advice real time for effective decision making. It also enabled real time reporting of incidences relating to electoral violence to security agencies who in most cases responded immediately and quelled violence. The paper contends that election monitoring and its management can be made effective when communication tools such as WhatsApp are utilized. The paper concludes that such platforms should be institutionalized by electoral agencies as effective tools for electoral monitoring and management.

With increasing human population and diminishing civil resources, there is an acute need for an entity that can deliver substantial improvement in both the scope and quality of these services. For such an entity to make informed decisions, it is vital to accumulate and assess data that is continuous and complete. However, the prevalent system of data curation is atomistic resulting in policy decisions often based on point-in-time data. Additionally, most of this data resides with the industrial complex and governmental entities, and rarely with the individual citizen and civil society. Hence, it is essential to institutionalize a holistic approach to data management, which conjointly meets the requirements of all stakeholders. In this paper, we present a brief of our ongoing research to design such an institution in the form of a data bank using blockchain technology to govern healthcare and education."

Amity being a pioneer in synergizing ICT into teaching-learning methodology started its Phase One of Flipped Classroom implementation for the current session. The entire Flipped Classroom Model (FCM) aims at creating a Learner-Centric classroom, rather than traditional teacher-centric education system. It was implemented with selective seven institutions and nineteen subjects. The Flipped Classroom Coordinators (FCC) were diligently selected, designated and trained upon with the basic essentials. Each FCC in turn contributed to numerous brainstorming sessions to identify the subjects. The SMEs and Instructional designers have developed a robust ""content development plan"", which served as a backbone for the content development (Multimedia and Textual) of the nineteen selected subjects. Faculty were introduced and motivated towards the new formats of presentation and assessment patterns of FCM. The developed videos and textual contents were uploaded into the Learning Management System (LMS) and the learners were provided access through the University Management System called Amizone. As proposed, Phase Two of the implementation process will follow by taking at least one subject of every semester of every course and for all the Amity Institutions. Consecutively Phase Three will follow by reframing the entire system with complete implementation of the FCM in all subjects, for all semesters and relatively for all the Amity Institutions worldwide. The impact of this model on the learning experience of learners will be analyzed keeping their performance and learning outcome as reference."

There is an apparent shortage of the experts in the field of Radiology and Dental Imaging especially in remote public healthcare centres in India. Primary/ Secondary Health Care Centres are run by primary level health care physicians and lack the required expertise to interpret the radiographs. Many secondary and tertiary level hospitals may also lack the expertise available at centres of excellence. CollabDDS: Collaborative Digital Diagnosis System is one such ICT tool in the field of radiology which allows collaboration by virtue of simultaneous visualization, annotations and manipulations of medical and dental images such as digitized X-Ray images, digital X rays, MDCT, MRI data (DICOM) for diagnosis and treatment planning in real time. With the spread of high bandwidth networks, this tool would help in providing better healthcare facilities in terms of Radiological services in remote areas. CollabDDS is an outcome of the Model Project ""Network Enabled Medical Diagnosis and Education in Skeletal Imaging using X-Rays"" funded by the National Knowledge Network (NKN). With the proof of concept having gone through successfully, it has been successfully implemented in 7 Medical/Dental colleges on NKN in pilot mode. It has been further extended to 41 Medical colleges connected on the National Medical College Network (NMCN) in pilot mode as a prelim to roll out. CollabDDS involves the synergy of expertise of health sciences, radiologists, dental specialists, software engineers and digital imaging. National Informatics Centre (NIC), Departments of Orthodontics and Radiodiagnosis, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IITB) and Central Scientific Instruments Organization (CSIO), Chandigarh have come together for the development of CollabDDS. The main feature of CollabDDS which makes it more advanced than the existing Teleradiology systems is real time collaboration across Networks. All standard images and DICOM data can be transmitted and shared in real time. This real time collaboration is of extreme value to both patients and primary level physicians in rural areas as it provides radiological consultation with experts sitting at tertiary centres and thus provides faster diagnosis and treatment. This result in huge saving in terms of time and money spent in travelling to distant hospitals providing these facilities. CollabDDS also allows creation of a repository of teaching files for education and training purposes at medical and dental colleges. This central repository can be used by the Teaching staff at the hospitals across the country."

But as the supply of online service delivery has improved, the consequences for those who are unable to use them also rise. As leading countries are now pursuing various ""digital by default"" policies, vulnerable segments of the population risk falling further behind in accessing socio-economic opportunities. Access to ICTs remains a key hurdle to e-government usage around the world and this is not only a challenge to emerging markets. To the contrary, it is precisely in developed countries where large portions of the population is moving online that the risk may be greatest. Digital divides therefore pose a threat to both social inclusion broadly and electronic inclusion (e-inclusion) more specifically. A forward-looking framework for how to prioritize various divides from a policy perspective is needed. To help analyze the challenges facing countries at different stages of economic development, this article presents ongoing research in the form of a cyber dependency matrix to identify the different digital divides they are likely to face as they progress in their digital development journey."

An ambiguity of social media legal nature as a private or a public space provokes many debates on ethical and legal aspects of 'official' and 'personal' use of social media by public employees. Many countries nowadays adopted special and detailed provisions aiming to monitor online activities of public servants in order to guarantee fairness, impartiality and neutrality of public service and avoid any adverse interference in public administration. Following this general tendency, Russia has also adopted in 2016 a new law containing an obligation of public servants to declare any use of social media before their authorities. The authors seek to provide a brief review of existing international and national practice in regulating social media use by public employees and presume possible consequences and risks for Russia."

While the trend used to encourage the role of states in independent media regulation, they are currently part of the equation but with shared responsibility. It is nowadays more related to characteristics deriving from the theoretical construct of media governance. This paper reviews the concept on media governance and presents a list of characteristics which contribute to our understanding of media regulation in a time when uncertainty and diffuse media practices challenge the role of state media regulation."

The lack of such infrastructure and technical resources makes learning within government, across political and economic regions (such as the EU) and cross-border learning challenging. The use of open standards such as the European Union Interoperability Solutions for Public Administrations (ISA) Core vocabularies for describing government policies could enable the development of robust intra and inter-government policy indexing and search infrastructure. This poster describes a policy vocabulary developed through the systematic and detailed analysis of policy documents spanning several sectors. We present the conceptual model for the vocabulary and describe its major classes."

We have used an affordable thermal camera combined with intensive patient monitoring and analytics to successfully enable digitization of whole body, non-contact sensing of temperature patterns. The utility of relative and absolute temperature patterns was tested for early diagnosis of various ailments such as circulatory shock. Image analytics combined with the development of computer algorithms enabled us to validate these patterns which can be deployed for remote community based care in the absence of adequate clinical staff and scarcity of resources. The use of this approach can help health workers such as ASHA workers to visualize, record and share whole body temperature patterns with the specialists via telemedicine helping them to make an informed decision. These techniques can be extended for use in adults and we plan to validate these for early detection of severe conditions eventually saving more lives through telemedicine."

Since more and more citizens are using cell phones and other mobile devices, it seems clear that there is an opportunity for government to provide services using related technologies, what has recently been called mobile government. Based on configuration theory, concepts from business models, and a set of individual interviews, this paper proposes a preliminary business model for mobile government, particularly using SMS (short message service) technology. The paper shows how the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in the Paraná State in Brazil has been using an innovative model to deliver services to citizens, which public managers can use as a model to better understand and help them begin a mobile government project using this technology. Therefore, the paper proposes a business model and tests it for the case of the DMV in the state of Paraná in Brazil."

Individual-level microdata collected between 2005 and 2010 indicates differences in socio-economic and demographic patterns of technology adoption, usage, and skills over time. Inequality in ICT access, use and skills reflects pre-existing inequality in other areas of economy and society. The ICT sector in Kenya is more active in urban areas, resulting in wide regional disparities in the distribution of ICT facilities. Despite the high overall diffusion rates of ICT in Kenya, there remains a clear digital empowerment gap in access and use between various demographic groups. Household income, education and gender are the key determinants of existing digital inequality."

At the same time, it is now the moment to generate data that allow us to understand the measures adopted. Diverse research suggests that OG contributes to creating better conditions for political and social dialogue, normative frameworks to be translated into laws and regulations, organizational change in public administrations, as well as the creation of software, applications and useful processes for citizens. At the same time, it is unclear the scope of concept or its relationship with other areas of public policy (like transparency, participation, e-government, social media, open data, etc.). This paper presents a research about the Open Government (OG) phenomena in Spanish municipalities over 50,000 inhabitants (146 municipalities), using a questionnaire. Particularly the research objective of this study is looking at the perceptions of city managers responsible of OG policies in order to understand more about this emergent public policy in the local layer of government. In order to achieve this purpose, the following research question has been raised: What is the perception of those who manage OG about this concept? The results are consistent with a notion of OG associated to terms like transparency or access to information, and less to collaboration, co-production, technologies or electronic government."

So, while good content exists, not all are able to benefit from it. The intent of our research effort is to be able to make existing web content be more accessible to wider range of end-users who may have different sociocultural and cognitive abilities. We propose to overcome this gap at a Presentation Semantics level by developing a framework for renarration through Semantic Style Sheets. Using this framework, we facilitate the renarration of existing educational content to be used by thus far overlooked community of users."

Hence, in this paper, we build an Internet Governance maturity model which can act as a benchmark towards assessing a nation's maturity in handling these issues. While primarily being descriptive, the maturity model be considered prescriptive when nations can take specific steps towards attaining a higher maturity of Internet governance. Further, the paper studies India's maturity position in detail to validate the prescribed model."

We evaluate strengths and weaknesses of the current options available using IS literature on information quality, agricultural information adoption literature and knowledge adoption literature. We find that most of the current options are lacking in one aspect or another; and go on to speculate that this is one of the reasons for low use of the technological options. We then present results from a project conducted in Karnataka which combined elements of several information delivery mechanisms and focused on various aspects of information quality and show the potential that information dissemination holds for improving productivity and financial and ecological sustainability of agriculture."

E-Gov adoption is an important area to research. Extant e-Gov adoption models are narrow in their scope and focus on partial issues. Methodologically they do not provide strong theoretical framework and have not comprehensively integrated all factors of e-Gov adoption. Therefore, the need arises to explore the factors that influence citizens to adopt e-Gov services. In order to assess e-Gov services, numbers of e-Gov maturity stage models have been proposed by researchers, consulting firms, and international organizations. Characteristics of different type of e-Gov services differ and different service maturity levels offer different modes of service with different levels of association of technology. As a result, adoption criteria for e-Gov services of different maturity stages might have significant implications on their adoption. The critical factors that influence citizens to adopt e-Gov services at different maturity levels may vary. The aim of this study is to identify the factors that influence citizens to adopt e-Gov services and the factors to adopt e-Gov at different stages of service maturity. In addition, the study will also identify the factors that will influence users to move from using e-Gov services of one maturity stage to another maturity stage. Qualitative as well quantitative research methodologies are used for the purpose of this research. Qualitative research will be used to develop theories and suitable here because e-Gov research is in premature stage. Findings from qualitative research will be further validated by quantitative technique."

Such a transformation in the field of education has been brought by Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) which aim to empower learners through an online medium of training overcoming physical and financial limitations. However, this large scale intervention is marred by a serious dropout problem. This paper address the dropout problem in MOOCs through improvement in its interface design. I assert that it is imperative to identify the cause of the mismatch between the goals of designer (in terms of his expectations) and that of the participants (in terms of their intentions) for using the MOOC. In this paper, I present affordances as the 'theory of solution' to facilitate bidirectional communication between the instructor and participants through a better design, thus leading to lower dropout rates. I conduct a longitudinal case study to analyze the design and use phases of a MOOC in a premier management institute. Through this work, I plan to contribute towards extending the understanding of the affordance concept in the field of Information Systems by developing an Affordance Perception-Actualization-Assessment process model. This work has strong policy implications in identifying and correcting the causes of high dropout rates among learners using MOOCs."

SIGEVA is a set of applications for the management and evaluation of researchers and projects in the National Research Council (CONICET) in Argentina. The relevance of the case relies on promoting overcoming barriers in data exchange, although it exhibits several drawbacks. The case study is analyzed focusing in data interoperability; particularly in how to model a middleware to improve data interoperability between organizations with heterogeneous software applications. We show that data interoperability between organizations is a tendency to improve the activities of end-user, breaking down information silos. Furthermore, the solution requires to consider the levels of interoperability and barriers during the development process. Finally, in view of the detected problem, we propose a data interoperability solution with the properties of ensuring semantic consistency and overcoming heterogeneity."
